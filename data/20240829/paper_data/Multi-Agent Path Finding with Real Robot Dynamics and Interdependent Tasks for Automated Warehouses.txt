Abstract
Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is an important optimization problem underlying the deployment
of robots in automated warehouses and factories. Despite the large body of work on this topic, most
approaches make heavy simplifications, both on the environment and the agents, which make the
resulting algorithms impractical for real-life scenarios. In this paper, we consider a realistic problem
of online order delivery in a warehouse, where a fleet of robots bring the products belonging to each
order from shelves to workstations. This creates a stream of inter-dependent pickup and delivery
tasks and the associated MAPF problem consists of computing realistic collision-free robot trajectories
fulfilling these tasks. To solve this MAPF problem, we propose an extension of the standard Prioritized
Planning algorithm to deal with the inter-dependent tasks (Interleaved Prioritized Planning) and a
novel Via-Point Star (VP*) algorithm to compute an optimal dynamics-compliant robot trajectory to
visit a sequence of goal locations while avoiding moving obstacles. We prove the completeness of our
approach and evaluate it in simulation as well as in a real warehouse.
