1 Schematic of the proposed framework. Specifications, boundaries, and loading conditions are provided in natural
language. The large language model (LLM) Agent generates a candidate solution, which is then evaluated using finite
element method (FEM) that serves as a discriminator. The FEM provides feedback to the LLM Agent in the form
of a solution-score pair, enabling the LLM to identify and implement the modifications needed to meet the specified
requirements. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2
