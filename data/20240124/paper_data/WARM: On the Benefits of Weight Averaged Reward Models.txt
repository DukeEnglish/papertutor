1. Introduction
Rewardmodeling. ConversationalassistantssuchasGemini[1]orGPT-4[2]haverevolutionizedthe
AIcommunityandbeyond. TheseLLMsarecapableofcompletingnovelandintricatetasks,including
mathematics, coding, and tool use [3]. These advancements are underpinned by a systematic three
stagetrainingprocedure: pre-trainingbynexttokenprediction[4,5,6],supervisedfine-tuning(SFT)
to learn to follow instructions [7, 8, 9], and ultimately, reinforcement learning (RL) to maximize a
rewardencapsulatingthedesiredbehaviors[10]. However,definingsuchrewardsforreal-worldtasks
isnon-trivial[11]. Inreinforcementlearningfromhumanfeedback(RLHF)[12,13,14,15],rewards
are reward models (RMs), trained on binary preference datasets to emulate human judgment. The
enhancement of LLM capabilities from RL is strongly tied to the quality of the RMs [16].
Reward hacking. ParticularlyinsidiousinRLHF[17,18]istherewardhackingissue[19,20,21,22]
(a.k.a. reward overoptimization), arising from reward misspecification [23, 24] between the proxy
RM and actual human preferences. While optimizing for the RM initially provides improvements, in
later stages the policy (i.e., the LLM being trained) usually learns to exploit loopholes in the RM and
achieves high rewards without truly fulfilling the intended objectives, as illustrated in Figure 1(b).
Thisrewardhackingphenomenonposesnumerousissues. First,itdegradesperformances,manifesting
as linguistically flawed [25] or unnecessarily verbose [26] outputs, which do not reflect true human
preferences. Second, it complicates checkpoint selection due to the unreliability of the proxy RM,
echoing Goodhart’s Law [27]: “when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure”.
Third,itcanengendersycophancy[28,29]oramplifysocialbiases,reflectingthelimitedandskewed
demographics of feedback providers [30, 31]. Lastly and most critically, misalignment [32, 33] due
to reward hacking can escalateinto safety risks [19, 34, 35], in particular given the rapid integration
of LLMs in everyday life and critical decision-making. Such concerns underscore the need to mitigate
reward hacking to ensure the beneficial and safe deployment of LLMs.

Challenges. Two primary challenges underlie reward hacking. The first major issue are the distribu-
tion shifts encountered by the RM [36, 37]. Indeed, the generations from the policy might deviate
substantially from those in the offline preference dataset, posing an out-of-distribution (OOD) chal-
lenge. Moreover,thosedistributionshiftsareaccentuatedbythepolicydriftduringtheRLprocedure:
the policy moves away from its SFT initialization, continually altering the distribution of predictions
the RM needs to interpret reliably. Second, preferences are inconsistent: the binary labels in the
preference dataset are noisy. Indeed, human labelers often rely on simpler criteria (length, bullet
points, politeness) over more nuanced indicators. Moreover, errors can be exacerbated for complex
tasks requiring specific expertise [38], and because of the multi-objective nature of alignment [39]
requiring handling the heterogeneity of human opinions. Overall, this results in a low inter-labeler
agreement (72.6% for InstructGPT [40]), altering the robustness of the RM.
Goal and ensembling baseline. Designing good RMs must meet a tripartite objective: guiding RL
efficiently, reliably scoring generations despite the distribution shifts, and providing robust signals
amidstlabelnoise. Toaddressthesechallenges,theseminalworkonRLHFfromChristianoetal. [12]
and more recent works [41, 42] leveraged prediction ensembling (ENS) [43], averaging the rewards
from multiple RMs. ENS improves the reliability of the reward and mitigates hacking risks [41, 42].
Yet, ENS suffers from memory and inference overhead causing efficiency challenges; we will also
show that ENS fails to improve robustness to label noise in the preference datasets.
WARM. In this paper, we propose weight averaged reward models (WARM), a simple, efficient and
scalable strategy to obtain a reliable and robust RM by combining multiple RMs. Starting from a
shared pre-trained LLM, we launch multiple RM fine-tunings: in practice, the different runs have
different hyperparameters (as in grid search), and see the preference data in different orders, thus

leadingtodiverseRMs. AkeycontributionishowthedifferentRMsaremerged: bylinearinterpolation
in the weight space. This follows the findings from the linear mode connectivity (LMC) [44, 45] and
weight averaging (WA) literature [46, 47, 48]: under shared pre-training, the different weights can
be linearly interpolated despite the non-linearities in the architecture.
On the benefits of WARM. Firstly, WARM stands out for its efficiency and practicality. By requiring
a single model at inference time, it provides a scalable approximation to the traditional, costlier
ensembling of predictions, without its memory and inference burdens. Secondly, WARM improves
reliability by inheriting from the generalization abilities of WA under distribution shifts, a quality
well-documented in the OOD literature for supervised learning [47, 48, 49]. Lastly, WARM improves
robustnesstolabelcorruption. WeshowthatWAselectstheinvariantpredictivemechanisms[50,51]
across different runs [52, 53], thus naturally diminishing the memorization of corrupted samples,
occurring in each run in different ways. In contrast, ENS simply memorizes the corrupted samples.
We also explain why reducing memorization when modeling noisy preferences enhances stability in
the RL process. These multifaceted benefits of WARM are further explored in Section 4.
We summarize our contributions as follows.
1. Innovation in reward modeling. We introduce WARM, the first instance of weight averaging for
reward modeling. This novel strategy efficiently mitigates reward hacking, improves reliability
under distribution shifts and robustness to label corruption.
2. Theoretical and empirical insights into weight averaging. We validate linear mode connectivity
for reward models trained on binary preference datasets. Moreover, we reveal a key difference
between weight and prediction averaging, that appears clearly under label corruption; weight
averaging only maintains the invariant predictive mechanisms across runs, thereby diminishing
memorization and enhancing the focus on generalizable features.
Our experiments on summarization tasks in Section 5 confirm that WARM improves performance
without any memory or inference overhead, either when used as the reward selector in best-of-𝑁,
or as the proxy RM in RL. WARM mitigates reward hacking, and thus provides better downstream
policies;specifically,itleadstoawinrateof79.4%(accordingtothepreferenceoraclemetric)against
a policy trained with a standard RM.
2. Context and challenges
2.1. Context
LLMs. We consider an LLM 𝑓 𝜃 of a fixed non-linear architecture parameterized by 𝜃, usually a
Transformer with attention layers [54]. It defines a policy by mapping prompt inputs 𝑥 to 𝑓 (𝑥).
𝜃
Followingthefoundationmodelparadigm[55]andthesuccessoftransferlearning[56], theweights
𝜃 are first pre-trained [4] on the vast amount of web data into 𝜃𝑝𝑡, before supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) [7] to learn to follow instructions into 𝜃𝑠𝑓𝑡. However, the high cost and limited scope of
instruction data (i.e., prompts and responses) can create a misalignment [19, 32, 33] between the
LLM and its intended application. Reinforcement learning (RL) as a third step in the training process
of LLMs was shown to help alignment of LLMs with the intended usage [40].
RMs. AnotableaspectofRListheabsenceofsupervisedsamplestobeimitatedbythepolicy;instead,
the focus shifts to maximizing the reward of generated samples, that should measure their quality.
The challenge is that the oracle reward, perfectly encapsulating the desired behaviors, is not given by
the environment. The key innovation from RLHF [12] is that this reward is the output of a reward
model (RM), trained in a supervised way to predict and thus reflect human preferences. Specifically,

𝑥 andgeneration 𝑦. Theweights𝜙areusuallyinitializedfrom (cid:0)𝜃𝑠𝑓𝑡,𝜔(cid:1),wherethefinallinearlayer𝜔
is added on top of the extracted features from the SFT model 𝜃𝑠𝑓𝑡. Then 𝜙 is trained on a preference
dataset D = {𝑥 ,𝑦+,𝑦−}𝐷 where the generation 𝑦+ has been preferred over 𝑦− to continue 𝑥 .
𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 𝑑 𝑑 𝑑 𝑑=1 𝑑 𝑑 𝑑
Usually human labelers evaluate those generations, but recent works on RLAIF [57, 58] showed
that similar performances can be obtained by prompting an LLM for AI feedback. Following the
Bradley-Terry [59] assumption about the distribution of preferences, and by framing the problem
as binary classification, the maximum likelihood principle motivates learning 𝜙 by minimizing the
following negative log-likelihood loss (where 𝜎 is the logistic function):
L 𝑅(cid:0)𝑟 𝜙,D 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛(cid:1) = −𝔼 (𝑥,𝑦+,𝑦−)∈D𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛(cid:2)log𝜎(cid:0)𝑟 𝜙(cid:0)𝑥,𝑦+(cid:1) −𝑟 𝜙(𝑥,𝑦−)(cid:1)(cid:3) . (1)
.
Reward inference. With this RM, the literature suggests applying any kind of RL algorithm (usually
REINFORCE [60] or PPO [61]) to fine-tuned 𝜃𝑠𝑓𝑡 into 𝜃𝑟𝑙, as analyzed in Section 5.2. A training-free
alternative is best-of-𝑁 (BoN) sampling, analyzed in Section 5.1, which returns the generation that
has the highest reward among 𝑁 generations from 𝜃𝑠𝑓𝑡. Both methods aim to align the policy with
human preferences. Yet, the reward misspecification [23] between the proxy RM and the true human
preferences can lead to reward hacking [19, 20, 21, 22], where the policy exploits loopholes in the
proxy RM to artificially increase the score without matching human preferences.
2.2. Challenges in reward modeling
When handling rich inputs such as text, or when assessing complex behaviours, designing rewards
aligned with human preferences is a complex challenge for two main reasons, described below.
Distribution shifts. The primary challenge is the distribution shifts resulting from the offline nature
ofpreferencedata. Indeed,thegenerationsinthepreferencedatasetandthosefromthepolicy𝜃𝑠𝑓𝑡 do
notnecessarilyfollowthesamedistributions,andtheshiftscanbecomeevenmorepronounceddueto
modeldriftduringRL.TheOODgeneralizationliteraturehasextensivelyanalyzedtherepercussionsof
these shifts. Firstly, they often lead to a reduction in performance [62, 63]. RMs (of limited capacity)
trained on narrow data distributions may rely on spurious correlations [51] or a limited number of
features[64],thusfailingwhenencounteringOODexamples[65,66]. Secondly,theycomplicatethe
selection of RMs, as ID validation metrics may poorly correlate with real-world OOD performances
[67, 68] and the ability to guide the RL [41]. Lastly, RMs can become poorly calibrated [69] in OOD
scenarios [70, 71], and predict more extreme values as rewards. Such miscalibration exacerbates
the problem in a negative feedback loop, further intensifying model drift and distribution shifts. In
conclusion, limited data coverage during reward modeling reduces the reliability of the RM and
facilitates reward hacking [36] in regions where the RM is badly specified.
Inconsistent preferences. The second major challenge is the label noise in preference datasets.
Human labelers, often grappling with fatigue, misunderstandings [72, 73] and imperfect incentives
[74], might default to simpler criteria such as length, bullet points, or politeness rather than more
causal indicators. This tendency is exacerbated for complex tasks [38] or when considering multiple
objectives, ranging from harmlessness [75] to engagement [76] and representing the heterogeneity
of human opinions. Consequently, these factors lead to low inter-rater agreement, where human
data appears as an imperfect representation of the underlying ground truth [77, 78]. To mitigate
these issues, there has been a shift towards AI-generated preferences [57, 58], which, while reducing
human labor costs, introduces its own set of noise and failure cases, such as sensitivity to prompting
strategies [79, 80]. These layers of noise and inconsistency challenge the robustness of the RM, and
its ability to provide stable signals.
4WARM:OntheBenefitsofWeightAveragedRewardModels
With this in mind, a good RM should ideally satisfy the three following properties.
Property 1: efficiency. TheRMshouldincurnomemoryorinferenceoverhead. Thenthepolicy
can be optimized efficiently.
Property 2: reliability. The RM should reliably reward predictions despite the distribution
shifts. Then the policy can explore away from its initialization while relying on the RM.
Property 3: robustness. The RM should be robust to the label inconsistencies in binary
preferences. Then the policy can learn from robust signals given by the RM.
2.3. Existing approaches
To tackle those issues, previous works have explored a few research directions, further detailed in
our related work from Appendix A.2. During RL, the standard strategy is to encourage the policy to
remain close to its SFT initialization with Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization [81, 82]; KL reduces
modeldrift[83,84]butcancauseunderfittingandaddsanextrahyperparameter(theregularization
strength 𝛼). Collecting, labelling and then training on new data (reflecting the evolving policy)
can improve the reliability of the RM [16]. Yet it poses significant efficiency challenges due to the
continuous requirement for human annotation and computational resources. In contrast, active
learning strategies [85, 86] proactively enrich the preference dataset by seeking out a diverse set of
generations and potential failure cases. Concurrent work [87] suggests applying label smoothing
and flipping. Finally, and most similar to WARM, prediction ensembling (ENS) [43] strategies average
the logits from 𝑀 RMs. From a bias-variance perspective [88], ENS reduces the variance term when
members are sufficiently diverse [89], and thus favors reliability under distribution shifts where
variance is the key issue [47]. From a RL perspective, ENS was shown to mitigate hacking risks
[12, 41, 42]. Despite its advantages, ENS faces efficiency challenges; the memory and inference
costs grow linearly with 𝑀, making ENS incompatible with the scaling trend in RMs, where larger
architectures consistently perform better [90]. Moreover, we will also show in Section 4.2 that ENS
fails to improve robustness to preference inconsistencies.
3. WARM
3.1. Weight averaging of reward models
Facingthosechallengesinrewardmodelingandthelimitationsfromexistingapproaches,wepropose
Weight Averaged Reward Models (WARM). WARM is a simple and efficient strategy that combines
multiple models without the memory and inference overheads of prediction ensembling, enhancing
rewardreliability(underdistributionshifts)androbustness(amidstnoisypreferencedataset). WARM
is illustrated in Figure 1(a) and described below.
1. Shared pre-trained initialization. For a given pre-trained LLM, each RM is initialized from
(cid:0)𝜃𝑠𝑓𝑡,𝜔(cid:1) combining SFT weights and a linear probed [91] classifier.
2. Diverse fine-tunings. We run 𝑀 RM fine-tunings, optimizing Equation (1) with diverse hyperpa-
rameters (as in a grid search), yielding 𝑀 weights {𝜙 }𝑀 .

3. Weight averaging. We average those 𝑀 weights together to form 𝜙WARM = 1 (cid:205)𝑀 𝜙.

and mitigates the weaknesses of the individual RMs.
3.2. Linear mode connectivity
Compared to ENS, the main difference lies in how WARM combines the different RMs: we do so
throughlinearinterpolationintheweightspace. Itreliesonthelinearmodeconnectivity(LMC)[44,45]
property across fine-tuned weights, i.e., the fact that the accuracy of the interpolated model is at
least as good as the interpolation of the individual accuracies. Precisely, by defining the pairwise
accuracy of an RM 𝑟 𝜙 w.r.t. a dataset D as Acc(cid:0)𝑟 𝜙,D(cid:1) = 𝔼 (𝑥,𝑦+,𝑦−)∈D(cid:2)1 𝑟 𝜙(𝑥,𝑦+)≥𝑟 𝜙(𝑥,𝑦−)(cid:3), the following
Observation 1 underpins the success of WARM.

whichledtoaplethoraofweightaveraging(WA)workssuchasthemodelsoups[46,47,48]variants
(detailed in our related work in Appendix A.1).
Remark 1 (Importance of pre-training and linear probing). The efficacy of WA can be surprising
given the non-linearities [54] and permutation symmetries [92] in deep neural network architectures.
WA is actually possible only because of the shared pre-training which constrains the divergence during
fine-tunings [45], such as the weights remain in convex regions of the loss valley [93]. In contrast, the
LMC does not hold when training weights from scratch [45], even if the random initialization is shared.
For these reasons and to facilitate the LMC, we follow [47, 48] and use linear probing to initialize the
classifier 𝜔; compared to random initialization, such linear probing prevents feature distortion [91].
3.3. Sources of diversity
On one hand, WARM requires shared pre-training so that the fine-tuned weights remain linearly
connected. On the other hand, weights must not be identical: actually, the diversity across those
fine-tuned weights significantly contributes to the accuracy gains observed in WA [47]. Overall, an
effective WARM requires a delicate trade-off between ensuring LMC and diversity across weights.
In practice, we use the following sources of diversity [94], leading the RM fine-tunings to diverse
yet linearly connected models. First, the different fine-tunings see the data samples in different
orders. Second, we sample slightly different hyperparameters, notably different learning rates and
dropout probabilities, as detailed in Appendix B.3. Third, we investigate a new source of diversity in
initialization named Baklava, illustrated in Figure 2. Specifically, we initialize the RMs’ featurizers
fromdifferentcheckpoints {𝜃𝑠𝑓𝑡 }𝑀 collectedalongagivenSFTtrajectory. Baklavarelaxestheshared
𝑖 𝑖=1
initialization constraint from model soups [46] to simply sharing the same pre-training: Baklava is
actually an efficient alternative to model ratatouille [48] but without the need of multiple auxiliary
tasks. Overall, Baklava increases diversity compared to only initializing from the last SFT checkpoint,
while adhering to the shared pre-training requisite for LMC, without incurring any overhead.

Remark 2 (Moving average). Following stochastic weight average [95] or moving average [96], we
also tried to average checkpoints collected along a single RM fine-tuning. Though interesting because less
costly for training, the lower results in Figure 3(a) suggest that the accuracy-diversity trade-off was not
favorable: incorporatingearlycheckpointswouldcompromiseindividualaccuracies,andconsideringonly
later checkpoints would not bring the necessary diversity. As a result, we opted to use in WARM only the
last checkpoint from each RM fine-tuning.
4. On the benefits of WARM
WenowexplorethepropertiesandbenefitsfromtheWARMstrategy,previouslydescribedinSection3.
WegroundouranalysisontheempiricalcomparisonbetweenWAandENSforrewardmodeling,and
a novel general theoretical comparison in Section 4.3.
Experimental setup. We leverage the TL;DR summarization benchmark [97], a standard in reward
modeling for LLMs, that we briefly describe below and further detail in Appendix B. The goal of the
RMs is to score summaries such as they are ranked properly. In training, we use the dataset D
𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛
from Stiennon et al. [14] where the candidate summaries are generated by GPT-3 [6] variants. To
obtain the labels, we follow the RLAIF procedure from [58], where a PaLM-L [98] is prompted with
chain-of-thought [99] to generate feedback mimicking human preferences. This strategy performs
similarly to human labelers with similar inter-agreement, and will be useful in Section 5 as an oracle
metric. The RMs are PaLM-XXS models, pre-trained and SFT-ed on the preferred summaries from
D , on which we plug a linear probed [91] classification layer. We train the RMs for 10k steps on

4.1. 1st order analysis: weight averaging for reliable and more efficient ensembling

this is validated in Figure 3 where the accuracy curves on D for WA and ENS closely match. This

similarity justifies that WA is a variance reduction method; then, because variance is the dominant
issue under distribution shifts [47], this explains the significant gains in Figure 3 over the individual

suggests improved reliability in WARM, with efficiency benefits over ENS: indeed, WA maintains a
single set of weights, removing the memory and inference overheads from ENS.

4.2. 2nd order analysis: weight averaging for more robust ensembling
A surprising fact remains unexplained. WA is slightly superior to ENS under distribution shifts,
which one can see on the plots from Figure 3, and more consistently in Figure B.1 from model soups
[46] or in Figure 1 from DiWA [47]. More generally, WA is the state-of-the-art strategy for OOD
generalization, consistently outperforming ENS; yet, this was not explained in previous works, thus
urging for new insights about the difference between WA and ENS.
Corruption setup. To refine our understanding on the difference between WA and ENS, we propose
a new setup where 25% of the binary labels are swapped in training. We then report the per-subset
accuracies on Figure 4, enriched in Appendix C.1 and aggregated in Figure 5. On the corrupted
subset of training data, the accuracy curve for WA is below the expected accuracies, while it is above
on all other subsets. More precisely, we make the following Observation 3.
Observation 3 (WA and ENS: 2nd order analysis). The accuracy gains of WA over ENS grow as data
moves away from the training distribution.
• WA ≪ ENS on train corrupt: WA is far worse than ENS on train samples with swapped labels,
showing reduced memorization and improved robustness to label corruption.
• WA ≤ ENS on train clean: WA is worse than ENS on train samples with correct labels.
• WA ⪆ ENS on ID val: WA is better or similar to ENS on samples without distribution shifts.
• WA ≥ ENSonOODtest: WAisfarbetterthanENSontestsamplesfromnewdistributions,showing
better reliability under distribution shifts.

Setup. We follow Lin et al. [53], and consider a simplified binary classification setup with labels
𝑦 ∈ {−1,1}, related to 𝐹 features {𝑧𝑗}𝐹 such as 𝑧𝑗 ∈ ℝ𝑑. From inputs 𝑥, we train a binary classifier
𝑗=1
𝑟(𝑥) = 𝜔⊺𝑓(𝑥). Following [53], we make three key assumptions. First, features orthogonality: we
assume that {𝑧𝑗}𝐹 are orthogonal, i.e., (𝑧𝑗)⊺𝑧𝑗′ = 0 when 𝑗 ≠ 𝑗′. Second, input as bag of features: we
𝑗=1
assume that the input 𝑥 = (cid:2) 𝑥𝑗(cid:3)𝐹 ∈ ℝ𝐹×𝑑 can be represented as the concatenation of 𝑥𝑗 generated
𝑗=1
by 𝑥𝑗 ∼ N(cid:0)𝑦 ·𝑧𝑗,𝜎·I𝑑(cid:1) with 𝜎 ≪ 1. Finally, the binary featurizer assumption: we consider that the
featurizer 𝑓 = (cid:2) 𝑓𝑗(cid:3)𝐹 ∈ {0,1}𝐹 is a binary selector of the features that make the input. For example,
𝑗=1
if 𝑦 = 1, 𝐹 = 3, 𝑥 ≈ [𝑧1,𝑧2,𝑧3], and 𝑓 = [1,0,1] learns to extract the first and third features, then
𝑓(𝑥) ≈ 𝑧1 + 𝑧3. We denote 𝑝 the probability that the featurizer 𝑓 learns to use the 𝑗-th feature
𝑗
dimension (associated with 𝑧𝑗); this means 𝑓𝑗 is 1 with probability 𝑝 and 0 otherwise. Moreover,
𝑗
for infinite training samples and under some constraint on 𝜎, Lemma 5 in [53] proved that, to learn
𝑟 = 𝜔⊺𝑓, the optimal linear fit 𝜔 on the features selected from 𝑓 would be 𝜔 = (cid:205)𝐹 𝑓𝑗 ·𝑧𝑗.

Interpretation. For ENS, the coefficient for a given feature is 𝒑 , the same as the probability of
𝒋
this information being used by any individual network. In contrast, WA involves the square of the
probability 𝒑2. Thus WA reduces the reliance on features with low probability, related to minor
𝒋
specificinformation(suchasnoiseorcontext)whichcanbeusedtofitthecorruptedtrainingsamples;
this would reduce memorization, and thus explains the robustness of WA under label corruption.
Reciprocally, WA tends to prioritize the most probable features, favoring the mechanisms that are
consistently learned, in other words the mechanisms invariant across runs. Overall, WA acts as a
regularization, improving robustness under label corruption by tackling run-specific mechanisms
favoringmemorization,andimprovingreliabilityunderdistributionshiftsbypreservingrun-invariant
mechanisms favoring generalization.
Remark 3(Invariance). Wearguethatweightaveragingonlykeepstheinvariantpredictivemechanisms
across runs. This is in analogy with the invariance literature [50], popular for domain generalization
[51, 100] under spurious correlations, where the key idea is that the predictive mechanisms which are
invariant across domains are the causal ones that are stable under distribution shifts. This theoretically
connects two key paradigms for OOD generalization, ensembling and invariance, and shows that weight
averaging actually benefits from both.
Remark 4 (Extension to a deeper structure with 𝐿 layers). We obtain a square in 𝒑2 due to our
𝒋
simplified two-layer architecture. Yet, in full generality, using a deeper structure with 𝐿 layers would
lead to 𝒑𝑳. Intuitively, WA applies an AND-mask on the information, that need to be found both in the
𝒋
previous feature space and the next layer weights.
Remark 5 (From reward robustness to learnability). When applied to the design of RMs in WARM,
we now argue that WA facilitates WARM’s stability [87] by mitigating the reliance on some non-robust
features. Indeed, WA makes the WARM reward more robust to small (potentially adversarial [101])
perturbations [102], i.e., smoother [103] in the input space. This relates to the Lipschitzness property
of the reward [104, 105, 106], where the difference in predicted rewards is bounded by the distance in
input space. Fortunately, such smoothness is useful in RL [107], in particular for the stability of the
policy gradient [108] because “sharp changes in reward value are hard to represent and internalize”
[109]. This is studied in Lipschitzness is all you need [109] where the authors argue that “the local
Lipschitzness of the reward is a sine qua non condition for good performance”, required “to even learn
anything”. In summary, robustness improves stability and hinders the cascade of errors occurring when
minor input variations can cause large reward differences.

Inconclusion,wesummarizethebenefitsfromWARM. First,WARMisefficient,incurringnomemory
or computation costs, as it returns a single model. Second, WARM reduces variance while leveraging
mechanisms invariant across runs, thus improving its reliability under distribution shifts. Lastly,
WARM also addresses label corruption, thereby augmenting robustness to noisy preferences.
5. Experiments
To empirically validate WARM’s benefits described in previous section, we train PaLM-XXS RMs on
theTL;DRsummarizationbenchmark[97]wherepreferencelabelsaregeneratedbyaPaLM-Lmodel
prompted with chain-of-thought [99]. This AI labeling approach, increasingly common in recent
research [26, 41, 110] as an efficient alternative to human assessments, is motivated by studies
[57, 58] indicating that it correlates well with human preferences: critically, it provides an automatic
pairwise oracle preference metric to evaluate reward hacking (in a similar fashion to the distillation
setup from [17], discussed in Appendix C.4). In addition, we leverage a PaLM-XS RM for pointwise

controlrewardreaching80.1%accuracyontheOODdatasetD . Asverifiedinourexperiments,this
𝑜𝑜𝑑
control RM also detects hacking, as it benefits from a larger architecture and a disjoint pretraining
compared to the PaLM-XXS RMs of interest. Below, we explore two key scenarios: in Section 5.1,
WARM reranks outputs in best-of-𝑁 (BoN); in Section 5.2, WARM guides the RL procedure.
5.1. Best-of-𝑁 experiments
Setup. We start with best-of-𝑁 (BoN) sampling experiments in Figures 6 and 7. Given a dataset
of 𝐷 text prompts, for each prompt we generate 𝑁 summaries from a SFT policy, and then returns
the summary with the highest reward according to different RMs. We actually consider two SFT
policies;onebasedonPaLMarchitecture[98](𝑁 = 8, 𝐷 = 15000),theotheronT5architecture[111]
(𝑁 = 1000, 𝐷 = 1000). For the 𝑥-axis, we plot the KL between the BoN policy and the SFT policy,
whichcanbeapproximatedbylog(𝑁)−𝑁−1 [112,113]. BoNiseffective[16],especiallyinthelow-KL
𝑁
regime (i.e., for small 𝑁). We consider two setups, without (clean setup) and with (corrupt setup)
25% label corruption in the preference datasets for reward modeling, and denote in each setup the
weights {𝜙 }𝑀 sorted in decreasing accuracy on D .
𝑖 𝑖=1 𝑜𝑜𝑑
Control reward. Figure 6 shows that, in terms of pointwise control reward, WARM performs con-
sistently better than ENS (only with 𝑀 = 2 for computational reasons) and the two best individual
RMs 𝜙 1 and 𝜙 2; moreover, the gains get bigger for 𝑀 = 6. As a side note, we also observe that the
individual RM 𝜙 performs better in BoN in Figure 6(c) than 𝜙 though 𝜙 was better than 𝜙 on
2 1 1 2
D , highlighting that selecting the appropriate individual RM is not trivial [41].
𝑜𝑜𝑑
Oracle preference. In Figure 7, we leverage the pairwise oracle preference [58] metric to validate
better performance with WARM. We observe in Figures 7(a) and 7(b) that summaries selected with
WARM have a win rate of up to 92.5% against the random selection of a summary (from SFT). We
also see in Figures 7(c) and 7(d) that reciprocally, all selection strategies have a win rate lower than
50% against the summaries selected by WARM 𝑀 = 6.
5.2. RL experiments
Setup. ForRLfine-tuningofpolicies,wefollow[58]andusetheirmodifiedversionofREINFORCE[60]
withabaselinevaluescoreforvariancereduction,asimpleralgorithmthanPPO[61]yetstilleffective
for LLMs. Both policy and value LLMs are PaLM-XS, initialized from the same SFT model. We then
generate samples with the policy, compute the reward with the RMs and update the weights to
optimizethisreward. MoredetailsareavailableinAppendixB.4. Toreduceforgettingandencourage
the policy to remain close to its SFT initialization, we incorporate a KL regularization [81, 82]
controlled by a coefficient 𝛼, ablated in Figure 8(c), yet otherwise set to 0.003 in the clean setup and
0.01 in the corrupt setup. This KL serves as the 𝑥-axis in our plots to estimate model drift, as done in
the literature; same curves with the number of training steps as the 𝑥-axis in Figures 1(b) and 18.
Control reward. In Figure 8, we observe reward hacking; as the policy moves away from its SFT
initialization, the control reward collapses. Critically, WARM improves performances: in particular,

policiestrainedwithENS(with 𝑀 = 2forcomputationalreasons)arestillsusceptibletoearlyreward
hacking, while reaching absolute control rewards significantly worse than with WARM (even with
𝑀 = 2). In Figure 8(c), we confirm that the 𝛼 hyperparameter plays a crucial role; low values of 𝛼
such as 0.001 correspond to high KL, while high values of 𝛼 such as 0.01 entail low KL but a risk of
underfitting. From a practical perspective, this highlights that the optimal value of 𝛼 for WARM is
lower than for a single RM; this is because WARM can mitigate reward hacking, and thus the optimal
policies are obtained for larger values of KL.

6. Discussion
Benefits. WARM represents a flexible and pragmatic method to improve the alignment of AI with
human values and societal norms. This paper has detailed several of its benefits, and below, we delve
intoadditional,moreexploratoryadvantages. WARMfollowstheupdatablemachinelearningparadigm
[114], eliminating the need for inter-server communication, thus enabling embarrassingly simple
parallelization[115]ofRMs. Thisfacilitatesitsuseinfederatedlearningscenario[116]wherethedata
should remain private; moreover, WA would add a layer of privacy and bias mitigation by reducing
the memorization of private preference [52]. Then, a straightforward extension of WARM would
combine RMs trained on different datasets, for example, coming from different (clusters of) labelers.
This diversity could help WARM performances, but also from a multi objective perspective [117]; by
non-uniform interpolation of RMs, we could learn a set of personalized policies [39]. Furthermore,
as WA has been shown to limit catastrophic forgetting [118, 119], WARM could seamlessly support
iterativeandevolvingpreferences. Finally,apromisingresearchdirectionisextendingWARMtodirect
preference optimization (DPO) strategies [120], where averaging the RMs casts back to averaging
the DPO policies [121].
Limitations. WARM, while innovative, does face some limitations, notably two when compared to
prediction ensembling methods; first, prediction ensembling can benefit from the diversity brought
by combining RMs from various architectures and pre-trainings; second, prediction ensembling
can incorporate prediction disagreement into the reward to provide uncertainty estimation and
limit model drift. However, it’s been noted in [41] that simple averaging of logits often performs
comparably to more complex prediction aggregation functions that include uncertainty elements.
Another limitation is that, while WARM effectively reduces certain types of memorization, it does
not completely eradicate all forms of spurious correlations or biases inherent in the preference data.
For instance, if each individual RM predominantly relies on summary length as a criterion, WARM
is likely to replicate this tendency. Therefore, alternative methods (from the OOD generalization
literature?) might be required, for example those based on invariance regularization [51, 100] or
lastlayerretraining[122]. Finally,WARM onlyenhancesrewardmodelingwithouttacklingtheother
challenges in RLHF [18]; thus, to mitigate the safety risks [19, 34, 35] from misalignment [32, 33],
WARM must be considered within the larger context of responsible AI.
7. Conclusion
In conclusion, we introduce Weight Averaged Reward Models (WARM) to address two critical chal-
lengesinrewardmodeling: reliabilityunderdistributionshiftsandrobustnessunderlabelcorruption.
By averaging the weights of multiple RMs obtained from diverse fine-tunings, WARM appears as an
efficient solution to mitigate reward hacking in reinforcement learning from human feedback. Our
empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness when applied to summarization. We anticipate that
WARM will contribute to more aligned, transparent, and effective AI systems, encouraging further
exploration in reward modeling.

A. Related work
This paper leverages the insights from the OOD generalization literature, in particular from linear
modeconnectivity(seeAppendixA.1),andappliesthemtothedesignofefficient,reliableandrobust
reward models (see Appendix A.2).
A.1. Out-of-distribution generalization, linear mode connectivity and memorization
LMC in fine-tuning. Fine-tuning foundation models [55] into specialized models that generalize
well to new distributions is critical for many real-world applications [123, 124, 125]. Recently,
different variants of weight averaging (WA) were able to improve performance, such as moving
average [49, 95, 96], WiSE fine-tuning [126], model soups [46], DiWA [47] and model ratatouille
[48]. These works rely on the LMC [44, 45] across fine-tuned weights, which was extended to fine-
tuningsondifferenttasks[48,127,128],modalities[130]orwithdifferentlosses[47,131],although
[132]highlightedsomelimitations. WAwasalsousedrecentlyinRLsetups[39,133,134,135,136],
in particular in RLHF in [39, 136] but only to combine policies and not rewards.
Insights into WA. Specifically, WA comes with several benefits. First, WA flattens the loss landscape
[49]. Second, WA approximates prediction ensembling, thus reduces variance of the estimator
[46, 47] and tackles model misspecification [67]. Third, WA combines models’ abilities [137, 138],
which can be useful for multi-task [127], multi-objective [39] or in continual learning [118] setups.
Lastly, it has recently been shown that WA can provide some benefits under spurious correlations
[52, 53], with a phenomenon called FalseFalseTrue in [53]. These works [52, 53] share similarities
withourmemorizationexperimentsfromSection4.2,butwearethefirsttoanalyzeWAregularization
properties under label corruption, and their consequences on generalization. In contrast, in [52] the
networks are trained on different datasets while the theory in [53] is actually mostly developed for
prediction ensembling.
Memorization. Traditionalapproaches[139]tacklingmemorizationofcorruptedlabels[140]usually
require explicit regularization [141], specific data augmentation [142], loss adjustment [143] or
sample selection [144]. Some other strategies are based on ensembling: they filter out potentially
corrupted samples with self-labeling filtering [145, 146] or bagging diversity procedures [147]. As
far as we know, with WA we propose the first strategy combining multiple models trained on the
same dataset that manages to tackle corruption.
26WARM:OntheBenefitsofWeightAveragedRewardModels
A.2. Reward modeling
OneofthecentralchallengeinaligningLLMsistheabsenceofexplicitrewardsfromtheenvironment,
a.k.a. the outer alignment challenge [33]. While Inverse Reinforcement Learning [148] attempts
to derive a reward model (RM) from expert demonstrations, most recent efforts [12, 13, 14, 15,
40] primarily focus on learning from human preferences. Despite its importance to enhance LLM
performances post-RL and for safe deployment in real-world applications, how to best design RMs
has arguably receive less attention than it warrants. Some research [149] seeks to refine the loss
function from Equation (1). Other approaches are more data oriented: for example, LLaMA-2 [16]
involves continual learning of the RM to adjust to new generation distributions; [85, 150] follow an
active learning paradigm [151]. Augmenting rewards with tools [152] or additional information
[153] represents an even more recent and very promising trend. Limited efforts have been made at
the intersection of label corruption and reward modeling; [154] tried to filter the preference dataset
for small academic locomotion tasks, while the concurrent [87] suggests applying label smoothing
and flipping. Actually, reward ensembling is the most discussed method to mitigate reward hacking
[41, 42]; we show that WARM can beat ENS while removing its overheads. Finally, following DPO
[120], a recent trend merges reward modeling with policy learning; though, the policies still tend to
hack the preference data [155], and thus require only a few training steps and very small learning
rates. The WA of DPO policies, theoretically equivalent to the WA of RMs, is a promising research
direction with already significant empirical results on public benchmarks, as demonstrated in [121].
B. Implementation details
B.1. Dataset details
For summarization, we use the Reddit TL;DR dataset [14], containing posts from Reddit that have
been filtered to ensure high quality. The training summaries from [14] are generated by OpenAI
GPT-3 [6] variants. The dataset contains 123k posts, and ∼5% is held out as the ID validation set.
To generate the candidate responses in the OOD dataset D with 92k pairwise comparisons, we
𝑜𝑜𝑑
considered multiple PaLM-XS policies with high temperature, some of which are pre-trained only,
others SFT-ed and others RLHF-ed; the goal was to get a diverse set of summaries.
B.2. AI labeling details
While the ideal approach for evaluating our models would involve human preferences, we resort to
the cheaper AI labeling procedure from RLAIF [58]. We query an instruct fine-tuned PaLM-L [98]
LLM1, prompted to generate preference mimicking human preferences. Specifically, we follow the
“Detailed + CoT 0-shot” prompting strategy from RLAIF [58], the best one according to their results,
involvingzero-shotpromptingwithchain-of-thought[99],amaximumdecodinglengthof512tokens
and temperature𝑇 = 0.0 (i.e., greedy decoding). To avoid position bias, we run the AI labeler in the
twopossibleorderings. Thisstrategywasshowntoperformsimilarlytohumanlabellers,withsimilar
inter-agreement. For the corruption experiments, we swap the labels for 25% of the training samples.
B.3. Reward modeling details
The RMs are PaLM-XXS models [98]. They are first pre-trained, and then supervised fine-tuned on
the Reddit TL;DR dataset for 12k steps with a batch size of 128 and the Adafactor [156] optimizer
1AvailablethroughGoogleCloud’sVertexAIhttps://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/
learn/models.
27WARM:OntheBenefitsofWeightAveragedRewardModels
with a learning rate of 10−5. Following the Baklava recipe, we actually launch the reward modeling
from different checkpoints along this SFT fine-tuning, at steps {8k, 10k, 12k}; taking a too-early
checkpoint would drastically reduce RM accuracy, as observed in [157]. To convert this LLM into a
classifier, we plug a linear probed [91] classification layer (the same for all RMs); said differently,
even though the featurizers are actually from different SFT checkpoints, they share the same linear
probed classification linear layer. As explained in [91], it prevents features from moving too much
away from their initializations, which facilitates the LMC required for WA.
We train all RMs for 10k steps, a batch size of 128, the Adafactor [156] optimizer, a learning rate
sampled in {1e-5,4e-5,1e-4}, and a dropout probability in {0.05, 0.1}. This follows the practical
recommandations from [47] to leverage hyperparameters in a mild range to preserve the LMC.
Training for a longer number of steps could help, as it did not alter the LMC in previous works [48].
Inpractice,forthemainexperimentswithcleanlabels,welaunch10rewardmodelings;whenranked
indecreasingaccuracyon D 𝑜𝑜𝑑,wedenotethem {𝜙 𝑖}1 𝑖=0 1. Therefore,theRMsnamed𝜙 1 and𝜙 2 inthe
different plots are the two best according to their individual performances under distribution shifts.
Then, WARM 𝑀 = 2 is actually the RM defined per 𝜙1+𝜙2, while ENS 𝑀 = 2 averages their predictions.

More generally, WARM with 𝑀 weights is the WA of the 𝑀 best weights {𝜙 }𝑀 . The main motivation
𝑖 𝑖=1
of this weight selection procedure is to remove potentially bad RMs, as validated in Figure 10, in
which we consider different permutations across those 10 RMs. As a side note, we speculate that a
greedy procedure as in [46] could further improve performances.

B.4. Reinforcement learning details
Both policy and value models are PaLM-XS [98], initialized from the same SFT model. We then
generate samples from the policy with temperature𝑇 = 0.9, batch size of 128, the Adafactor [156]
optimizer, a learning rate of 10−5 and a policy warmup of 2k steps. We set 𝛼 = 0.003 for the KL
regularization in the main experiment without label corruption, and 𝛼 = 0.01 with label corruption.
Following [58], we used a modified version of REINFORCE [60] with a baseline value function for
variance reduction.

C.4. Distillation experiments
In Figure 22 we reproduce the distillation setup from [17], where the control PaLM-XS RM generates
the labels to train PaLM-XXS RMs. As a side note, we observed that distillation changes the diversity
across fine-tuned RMs, thus potentially altering the significance of the distillation setup, motivating
us in exploring the more realistic RLAIF setup.
