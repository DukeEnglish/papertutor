ABSTRACT
Existing reconstruction-based novel view synthesis methods for driving scenes
focus on synthesizing camera views along the recorded trajectory of the ego ve-
hicle. Their image rendering performance will severely degrade on viewpoints
falling out of the recorded trajectory, where camera rays are untrained. We pro-
poseFreeVS,anovelfullygenerativeapproachthatcansynthesizecameraviews
on free new trajectories in real driving scenes. To control the generation results
tobe3Dconsistentwiththerealscenesandaccurateinviewpointpose,wepro-
posethepseudo-imagerepresentationofviewpriorstocontrolthegenerationpro-
cess. Viewpointtransformationsimulationisappliedonpseudo-imagestosimu-
late camera movement in each direction. Once trained, FreeVS can be applied
to any validation sequences without reconstruction process and synthesis views
on novel trajectories. Moreover, we propose two new challenging benchmarks
tailoredtodrivingscenes,whicharenovelcamerasynthesisandnoveltrajectory
synthesis, emphasizing the freedom of viewpoints. Given that no ground truth
images are available on novel trajectories, we also propose to evaluate the con-
sistencyof imagessynthesized onnovel trajectorieswith 3Dperception models.
Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset show that FreeVS has a strong image
synthesisperformanceonboththerecordedtrajectoriesandnoveltrajectories.

Scenereconstructionandnovelviewsynthesis(NVS)havegainedspecialattentioninembodiedAI
due to their potential to develop closed-loop simulations for embodied systems. Recent advances
have led to remarkable improvements in the reconstruction quality of general scenes using multi-
passandmulti-viewrecordings.However,reconstructingdrivingscenespresentsdistinctchallenges
duetothesparseobservationsinherentintheirlesscontrolled,real-worldrecordingconditions.
Unlikegeneralscenereconstructionsettings,whichtypicallyleverageexcessiveviewssurrounding
thescene, drivingscenereconstructiongenerallyonlyhasaccesstoimageviewsalongthesingle-
pass ego driving trajectory. This limitation raises an important question: How well does driving
scenereconstructionperformfornovelviewpointsoutsidetherecordedtrajectory?
Currently, existing driving scene NVS works(Guo et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023c; Xie et al., 2023;
Turkietal.,2023;Yangetal.,2023a;Zhouetal.,2024b;Chenetal.,2023;Yanetal.,2024)only
evaluate their image rendering quality along the recorded trajectory, leaving this question largely
unanswered. As shown in Fig. 1, the quality of rendering results of existing representative NVS
methodsdegradesdrasticallywhentherenderingcameramovesawayfromitsrecordingtrajectory.
Thisisbecause,indrivingscenes,recordedcameraviewpointsaresparsein3Dspaceandhomoge-
neousintheirpositionsalongtherecordedtrajectories. Thesparsityandhomogeneityofrecorded
cameraviewscausethecameraraysshootingfromthecameracentersonnoveltrajectorieslargely
untrained.
We propose FreeVS to address this issue, which is a fully generative NVS method that can syn-
thesizehigh-qualitycameraviewsinsideandbeyondtherecordeddrivingtrajectory. Wefacetwo
corechallengeswhenbuildingtheFreeVS.Thefirstchallengeisaccuratelycontrollingthecamera
poses while maintaining the 3D geometry consistency of the generated views. Although previous
diffusion-based methods(Wang et al., 2023a; Lu et al., 2023b; Hu et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024;
Yangetal.,2024)arecapableofcontrollingthecameramotioninacoarsetrajectory,theircontrol
precision is far from enough for safety-critical simulation purposes. The second challenge is the
ground truth images in the novel trajectories are unavailable, making it difficult to directly train a
modeltosynthesizenovelviewsbeyondrecordedtrajectories.
Totacklethetwochallenges,theproposedFreeVSleveragespseudo-imagerepresentation,asparse
yetaccuraterepresentationof3Dscenesobtainedthroughcolored3Dpointsprojection.Specifically,
for each existing view, we create its pseudo-image counterpart by projecting colored point clouds
intothisview. Herethecoloredpointscanbeeasilyobtainedbyprojectingpointcloudstoanyvalid
images. Inthisway,weobtaintrainingdatapairstotrainagenerativemodelthatcangenerateareal
image from its pseudo-image counterpart. Since we create the pseudo images using ground truth
cameramodels,theycontainsparsebuthighlyaccurateappearanceandgeometry,sidesteppingthe
tough challenge of accurately controlling the camera poses. At inference time, we could create a
pseudo-image for a novel viewpoint beyond the recorded trajectory and then synthesize the novel
viewusingthetrainedgenerativemodel.Thisdesigngreatlynarrowedthegapbetweensynthesizing
viewsinsideandbeyondtherecordedtrajectory.
To reveal the practicality of FreeVS, we propose two challenging benchmarks for evaluating the
performance of NVS methods in driving scenes, which is more practically meaningful than the

Unifiedviewpriorrepresentation. Onemajorchallengeofgenerativenovelviewsynthesisisto
ensurethegeneratedimagesareconsistentwiththepriorsinthenovelview. Heretheviewpriors
include the observed colors, 3D geometry, and camera pose of this view. However, the different
typesofpriorsareintotallydifferentmodalities,posingasignificantchallengefordiffusionmodels
to precisely encode them. For example, as discussed in Sec. 1, diffusion models cannot precisely
controlthecameramotions(i.e.,poses). Totacklethischallenge,weproposeapseudo-imagerep-
resentationthatunifiesalltypesofviewpriorsinonemodality.Pseudo-imagesareobtainedthrough
colored point cloud projection. Specifically, for each frame in a driving sequence, we first merge
LiDARpointsacrossthenearbyr frames. LiDARpointsonmovingobjectswillbemergedalong

In driving scenes, modern image-based 3D perception models have achieved high robustness. As
showninFig.3(d),assuminganNVSmethodcansynthesizeviewsonanoveltrajectorywithideal
image quality, the perception model feed with synthesized views should still be able to produce
accurate predictions on the novel trajectory. With such an assumption, we believe that the perfor-
mance of an off-the-shelf perception model on novel trajectories can reflect the quality of images
synthesized by the NVS methods. Under the novel trajectory synthesis benchmark, we feed the
synthesized images and camera poses on the novel trajectory to an off-the-shelf 3D camera-based
detector. Thedetectionresultsareevaluatedwiththelongitudinalerrortolerantmeanaveragepreci-

across the adjacent ±2 frames of each frame. If a 3D LiDAR point has more than one projected

viewpoint transformation simulation, we randomly sample the target viewpoint sequence starting
from the adjacent ±4 frames of the first frame of the source point cloud sequence. We employ
a ConVNext-T(Liu et al., 2022) backbone as the pseudo-image encoder. We train the model for

mentioning that in Table 3, all previous reconstruction-based NVS methods exhibit a significant
performance drop when multi-view cameras are considered. We think this is due to the increased
number of training views, the expanded range of the visible 3D scene, and the rapidly changing
contentinlateralviews,allofwhichmaketheconvergenceofreconstructionmodelsmoredifficult.

Ablation study on viewpoint transformation simulation. Viewpoint transformation simulation
aims at constructing source and target frame pairs from recorded sequences to simulate camera
movement in various directions. We report the results of ablation studies on viewpoint transfor-
mation simulation with pseudo-images in Table 5. We report the performance of FreeVS under
the multi-view novel frame synthesis setting and on novel trajectories generated by applying 2.0
m lateral offsets to the recorded trajectories. As shown in Table 5, sampling target frames from
adjacent ±2 or ±4 frames from the source frame can boost the view-synthesize performance of
FreeVS on novel trajectories. When the temporal sampling window size exceeds ±4 frames, the
view-synthesizeperformanceofFreeVSontherecordedtrajectorywillbenegativelyaffected. We
believethisisduetothelargetimestampmismatchbetweenviewpriorsandtargetimageshindering
themodel’sconvergence.

Implementation details of NVS counterparts. For 3DGS which is not initially designed for un-
bounded driving scenes, we optimize its performance by adjusting its hyperparameters, including
setting the densification interval to 500 iterations, setting the opacity reset interval to 10000, and
training the 3DGS models for 100000 iterations while densifying 3D Gaussians until 50000 itera-
tions.WealsonoticedthattheStreetGaussiansmodelshaveaconvergenceissuewhentrainingwith
all 200 frames of each sequence. Therefore we split the validation sequences into two 100-frame
