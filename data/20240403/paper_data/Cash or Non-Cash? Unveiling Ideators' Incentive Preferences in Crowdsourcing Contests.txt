Abstract
Even though research has repeatedly shown that non-cash incentives can be effective,
cash incentives are the de facto standard in crowdsourcing contests. In this multi-study
research, we quantify ideators’ preferences for non-cash incentives and investigate how
allowing ideators to self-select their preferred incentive—offering ideators a choice
between cash and non-cash incentives—affects their creative performance. We further
explore whether the market context of the organization hosting the contest—social (non-
profit) or monetary (for-profit)—moderates incentive preferences and their effectiveness.
We find that individuals exhibit heterogeneous incentive preferences and often prefer
non-cash incentives, even in for-profit contexts. Offering ideators a choice of incentives
can enhance creative performance. Market context moderates the effect of incentives,
such that ideators who receive non-cash incentives in for-profit contexts tend to exert less
effort. We show that heterogeneity of ideators’ preferences (and the ability to satisfy
diverse preferences with suitably diverse incentive options) is a critical boundary
condition to realizing benefits from offering ideators a choice of incentives. We provide
managers with guidance to design effective incentives by improving incentive-preference
fit for ideators.

1Introduction
Crowdsourcing innovation contests broadcast an open call to the public (“crowd”)
inviting them to submit ideas and problem solutions. Successful crowdsourcing contests
typically draw on a wide pool of ideators, including employees, users, non-users,
suppliers, distributors, and professional ideators, tapping into diverse nationalities,
backgrounds, and socioeconomic groups [25,69]. The use of crowdsourcing enables both
for-profit organizations such as BMW, Danone, Fujitsu, Intel, Procter & Gamble or
Volkswagen, and non-profit organizations such as foundations, governments, federal
agencies or NGOs to access a wide variety of high-quality ideas and solutions [2].
Despite the widespread use of crowdsourcing contests, success depends on
participants’ effort and creativity in contributing high-quality solutions, with earlier
studies exploring factors such as prize structures [46,54,64], the number of contestants [11],
or entry barriers [26]. While incentives are a key contest design element in crowdsourcing,
as they are theorized to affect ideators’ effort and creative performance [65], it is not
clear which incentives are most effective. Previous studies show that ideators engage in
crowdsourcing for a variety of reasons [1,8,11,23,45] and a mismatch between incentives
and participants’ motives can backfire and lead to reduced effort [29].
Although we know that ideators are motivated to participate in crowdsourcing
contests for a variety of reasons, why are contests run by diverse organizations from for-
profit to non-profit all using cash prizes? Given the diverse motives of the heterogeneous
crowd that crowdsroucing contests aspire to attract, offering everyone the same incentive
hardly seems effective [29,37]. Could crowdsourcing contest designs be improved by
offering ideators a choice of different incentives?
In this paper we introduce incentive choice—which we contrast from a single, fixed
incentive that is “assigned” to all ideators—as a new incentive design aspect in
crowdsourcing contests. Incentive choice allows ideators to self-select between cash and
non-cash prizes the incentive they prefer. We theorize that incentive choice can alleviate
a central challenge in incentive design and that improving the incentive-preference fit
increases effort and performance (i.e., idea quality) in crowdsourcing contests [44,56].
We further theorize that market context—the for-profit or non-profit orientation of
the contest organizer—may be an important moderator for the effectivness of incentives.
In a non-profit context, participants may be happy to volunteer their time to solve societal
problems for mere recognition or praise. In a for-profit context, however, they may
expect cash in return for their efforts to help organizations remain financially successful
and gain competitive advantage. Market context may thus affect the effectiveness of non-
cash incentives. It may also affect preference for non-cash incentives in the first place.
Both of these aspects in turn may inform our understanding of boundary conditions under
which offering a choice of incentives can be effective.
We address the following research questions:
1. Do ideators prefer incentives other than cash when given the choice? While it
is plausible to assume heterogeneous preferences among crowdsourcing
participants, we seek to quantify what the most popular incentives are.
(Quantified in Study 1)
22. Does offering a choice of incentives improve quality and effort? (Main effect
examined in Study 2)
3. Does market context moderate the effect of incentives on quality and effort?
That is, are cash and non-cash incentives equally effective across for-profit and
non-profit contexts? (Moderator examined in Study 3)
4. What boundary conditions may constrain the main effect of incentive choice?
Specifically, if the mechanism behind the effect of offering a choice is increased
preference-incentive fit, the effect may depend on the degree to which ideators
actually prefer different incentives. (Boundary condition examined in Study 4)
In order to address our research questions, we offer evidence from four consecutive
empirical studies. We start by quantifying incentive preferences in a realistic field
experiment with over 1,000 participants (Study 1). Drawing on a broad population we
offer six different incentives in a non-profit context to assess ideators’ interest in
choosing their own incentive and measure popularity of different cash and non-cash
prizes. We establish that both cash and non-cash incentives are highly desirable. While
cash is the most popular individual choice (28%), when aggregating the different non-
cash options together, they account over 49%, and 23% prefer to make no choice at all.
Using an econometric technique to account for self-selection in incentive choice, we
establish preliminary evidence for the main effect of incentive choice: offering a choice
per se improves idea quality in the observational field experiment. We provide additional
evidence for the main effect of offering a choice from a randomized lab experiment
(Study 2) using the two most popular incentive choices from the field experiment (cash
and a donation). We find that offering a choice improves idea quality (but not effort).
Further, we show that ideators who choose the cash incentive produce lower quality ideas
and that ideators who choose the non-cash incentive exert less effort. This study also
offers insights into the specific form in which the incentive choice is delivered. It reveals
that ideators are not merely indifferent to incentive options and some may even choose to
forego incentives entirely.
As theory suggests that the effectiveness of incentive options may depend on the
market context—for-profit or non-profit—offering a choice of incentives may not be
equally effective in different market contexts. Indeed, we find that market context is an
important moderator of incentive effectivness in another randomized experiment
(Study 3). We show that effort is generally lower in for-profit settings and even lower
when combined with non-cash prizes. Finally, we test an important boundary condition in
our last experiment (Study 4): despite attracting diverse populations in terms of gender,
home country, or economic background, some online platforms may, over time, evolve
an environment in which individuals have homogeneous incentive preferences. Using a
sample of ideators drawn from a population of gig workers narrowly focused on earning
income, we find no interest in non-cash incentives and consequently no benefit to
offering a choice of incentives. Exploring this boundary condition suggests that
incentive-preference fit (and hence improved sorting) is the driving mechanism behind
the positive main effect of offering a choice (as opposed to the act of choosing itself).
This suggests an important practical implication for contest designers: Offering a choice
may not be effective in homogeneous ideator pools without diverse preferences.
3Our paper makes three contributions to the literature on crowdsourcing design and
incentive theory across different market contexts. First, we establish incentive choice as
an important contest design element and explain why it works by shedding light on the
underlying mechanism. This expands past work on crowdsourcing design which has
focused on contest design aspects like prize structures [46,54,64], number of contestants
[11], and entry barriers [26]. Second, we contribute to a better understanding of incentives
in crowdsourcing by showing how for-profit and non-profit market contexts moderate the
effect of incentives. Our study reveals how incentives can sometimes backfire when they
are misaligned with the market context in which they are used [29,65]. Third, we extend
previous research that has identified a range of reasons why individuals participate in
crowdsourcing [1,8,11,23,45] by quantifying the considerable degree to which this occurs
and that diverse motives result in diverse incentive choices. This guides subsequent
theorizing and highlights the advantages of providing alternative incentives in contest
design [58].
Our findings have practical implications as they enable managers to design more
effective incentives for crowdsourcing contests. Our work suggests that in addition to
cash incentives, crowdsourcing organizers should offer a choice of non-cash alternatives
for participants to voluntarily choose from, with cash as a clearly marked default option
to cater to ideators who are indifferent.
Theoretical Background
Incentives, Choice, and Market Context
Incentives refer to rewards that motivate or encourage someone to act. They are external
to the individual and embedded in a situation. Research is increasingly clear that rewards
play a complementary role to intrinsic motivation and spur desired behaviors but can also
be detrimental to intrinsic motivation and reduce desired outcomes [39]. The type and
level of a person’s motivation together with extrinsic incentives determine a person’s
likelihood to become active, as well as their level of activity in terms of frequency,
intensity, persistence, and performance [51,67]. Personal motives determine which
incentives are perceived as attractive and how they affect an individual’s behavior [52].
These reasons range from intrinsic motives (such as curiosity, interest in, and enjoyment
of the task) to internalized extrinsic motives (such as skill development, making friends,
or supporting others), to purely extrinsic motives associated with the outcome of their
engagement (such as monetary rewards) [1,8,11,23,45]. Individuals derive more
satisfaction from an activity and show higher levels of engagement the more the activity
fulfills their motives [61]. Therefore, it is crucial to offer incentives that align with
individuals’ motivations.
Incentives are generally thought to have three kinds of effects which can be captured
by a utility function with three components [9]: they value extrinsic rewards (the extrinsic
motivation component), enjoy doing an activity (the intrinsic motivation component), and
care about their image vis-à-vis themselves or others (the reputational motivation
component). This model implies that intrinsic, extrinsic, and reputational motivations are
not mutually exclusive but jointly predict behavior. However, how strongly each
4component factors into the utility function is specific to the individual and the context in
which these incentives are employed. Individuals have been shown to differ in both their
preferences for the enjoyment of a task and the image component of their utility [32]. This
has resulted in a robust literature on the limits of monetary incentives [28].
There are four reasons why non-cash incentives may be especially attractive
compared to cash incentives [36]. First, non-cash incentives avoid the need to justify
spending money. Second, they are visible to the social environment and thus may help to
build an individual’s image and reputation. Third, non-cash incentives may represent an
independent earning class. Because this earning class is mentally kept separate from other
earnings, it may be considered especially rewarding. Fourth, individuals may mentally
adjust the value of non-cash incentives depending on their personal perception and
emotional reaction.
Choice may allow a better incentive-preference match. As individuals’ utility
functions are heterogeneous, for some a cash prize may be considered the most rewarding
and appropriate incentive while for others the same prize may be considered
inappropriate and detrimental. For example, someone may have been looking for a
personal gift but received money instead. As organizers of crowdsourcing contests do not
know individuals’ incentive preferences upfront [48,56] it may be beneficial to allow
participants to choose their incentive and thus avoid the risk of an incentive-preference
mismatch. Research is scarce on how offering ideators a choice of incentives—as
opposed to a single, fixed incentive that is assigned equally to all ideators—influences the
effect of incentive on effort and performance. So far, some early studies have explored
the effect of choice between different pay schemes such as between fixed and
performance-based pay [14,57] and using observational data between monetary and
symbolic awards [53]. Yet no study has investigated choice between cash and non-cash
prizes more broadly nor have they investigated the underlying mechanism why such
incentive choices may be effective.
Market context may further affect the perceived utility of an incentive and thus influence
effort and quality [9,67]. For example, if you help a friend to fix a computer problem or a
stranger to jump-starting a car you may expect no monetary compensation and a warm
thank may be perceived as appropriate gesture. However, as IT administrator or a car
mechanic you may expect monetary compensation for the same activity instead of a mere
thank you. Hyman and Ariely [33] demonstrated that people categorize interactions based
on whether they occur in a social or monetary market context. Depending on this
classification, individuals may anticipate different incentives for the same activity.
Through a series of laboratory experiments, they found that the direct impact of cash,
non-cash rewards, or no incentives depends on whether the context is for-profit or non-
profit (referred to as the 'market relationship'). In monetary market contexts, individuals
adjust their effort and time according to the compensation offered, whereas they do not
necessarily expect monetary incentives for their involvement in a social market context.
Another study revealed that cash had a negative effect on the willingness to donate blood,
whereas a non-cash incentive, such as a voucher of equal value, did not produce the same
negative effects [40]. Thus, while previous research mainly focused on the direct effects
of cash and non-cash incentives on performance, there remain open questions about how
5market context moderates the impact of incentives on innovation performance in
crowdsourcing.
Related Work on Incentives and Creative Performance
Incentives represent a prominent research topic in crowdsourcing. This section provides
an overview of existing studies that examine how different cash and non-cash incentives
affect creative performance. Appendix 1 offers a review of existing empirical studies
investigating creative or innovation performance as a dependent variable. While the
review highlights the strong interest in exploring incentives and their effect on innovation
performance, especially lately in the crowdsourcing context [1,11,35,65] it mainly focuses
on the effect of cash rewards.
Further, existing research in psychology, education, and organizations examining the
effect of extrinsic incentives on creativity remains ambiguous and sometimes show
contradictory results (i.e., [3,17]). While some studies have suggested that rewards
undermine intrinsic motivation and thus creative performance (e.g., [4,27]), others show
that rewards lead to goal-directed behavior and thus increase creative performance [17].
More recent research has indicated that both intrinsic and extrinsic rewards may boost
creative outcomes once properly adjusted to participants and context [31]. Only two
studies [12,16] have explored the effects of cash and non-cash incentives on creative and
innovation performance. Researchers analyzed the impact of various types of rewards,
i.e., money and social cause on the contribution behavior in crowdsourcing campaigns
[12] and examined intrinsic and extrinsic rewards on creative performance through five
different studies [16].
While we know that participants in crowdsourcing contests have diverse incentive
preferences, there is only one study that investigates the offering of choice between
monetary and symbolic awards which uses observational data [53]. While the study did
not find a direct effect of choice on quality, it did reveal a mediation effect of choice
through effort: participants in the choice option allocated more time compared to those in
the no-choice option. This study shows initial evidence that choice matters, however it
does not disentangle the difference between cash and non-cash choice, the distribution of
preferences, use random assignment, nor does it shed light on the underlying mechanism.
Giving ideators the choice to select their preferred incentive among various options
rather than assigning a specific incentive remains an unexplored research avenue to
maximize the effectiveness of incentives.1
Our overview further shows that most empirical studies are set either in a for-profit
or non-profit context but do not compare effects across market contexts within the same
study, for example by considering market context as a moderator. In summary, although
we have knowledge of the direct effects of incentives, limited research exists about how
choice of incentives affects performance in crowdsourcing and how for-profit vs. non-
profit market contexts moderate the effect of incentives.
1 Examples of existing studies investigated self-selected goal-reward levels for sales employees [10]; a lab experiment allowing individuals to
choose between a fixed and performance-based pay [14]; and several studies that investigated self-selection of pay schemes allowing
individuals to select a competitive (tournament) scheme or piece-rates [19,57]. In all cases, the self-selected incentive choice affected the
overall expected compensation (mostly depending on the individual’s skill), not the type of compensation (i.e., cash vs. non-cash).
6Research Framework
This section introduces our research framework. We start from the assumption that
individuals have heterogeneous incentive preferences. We derive two hypotheses about
how incentive choice and market context moderate the effect of incentives on idea quality
and effort in crowdsourcing contests (Figure 1).

Main Effect of Incentive Choice. Giving ideators a choice of incentives may lead to
increased effort and performance. We theorize two different pathways for a main effect
of incentive choice. First, when individuals choose their preferred incentives this may
lead to a better incentive-preference fit, which amplifies the effect of the incentive itself,
which then spurs effort and idea quality. That is, giving ideators a choice can alleviate
poor incentive-preference fit. The mechanism behind the incentive-perference fit is
similar to mass customization, where customers self-configure products that meet their
needs better than standardized products because they provide a better match with their
preferences [22]. As incentive preferences of heterogeneous participants are not known
upfront, it may make sense to let them choose their incentive [13,37,47,53]. For this
mechanism to be effecitve, several conditions need to be met. Understanding these
conditions will lead to a better understanding of boundary conditions under which a main
effect of incentive choice may no longer materialize. First, the success of improving
incentive-preference fit relies heavily on offering “appealing” choice options, which may
not be an easy task. When participating in crowdsourcing contests, individuals must
perceive the available options as valuable and in line with their preferences [68]. Second,
in order to make choices that enhance incentive-perference fit, ideators must be aware of
their own preferences, as benefits may not materialize if ideators are merely indifferent.
In case of unclear incentive preference, choice could backfire by causing unnecessary
effort and confusion instead of a better incentive-preference fit [50]. Finally, ideators
have to have heterogeneous incentive preferences. Incentive choice will be unable to
generate improved incentive-preference fit if incentive preferences are homogeneous and
individuals (largely) make the same choice. Taking these boundary conditions into
account, choice of incentives should lead to a better incentive-preference fit and thus
increase the effectivness of incentives.
Second, an alternative reason for increased performance given a choice of incentives
rests on self-determination. Giving ideators a choice of incentives could grow their sense
of control over their actions, which in turn can raise intrinsic motivation [15] which
7increases ideators’ effort and idea quality. That is, the act of choosing an incentive may in
itself increase motivation by making ideators feel more self-determined and enhancing
their sense of autonomy and control. We hypothesize:
H1 (main effect): Incentive choice has a positive effect on a) quality, and b) effort.
Market Context as Moderator. Research shows that the effect of incentives on effort
and quality may depend on the market context and its perception as a monetary market or
a social market of the crowdsourcing contest [33]. That is, market context may moderate
the effect of different incentives because, depending on the context, individuals may have
different incentive expectations for the same activity. Consider getting help for a painting
job or preparing tax returns. In such situations, one may ask either a friend or a
professional [33]. While a friend may help without expecting a return [7], a professional
expects money for their time and effort [20]. Here, the relationship the person seeking
help has with the person providing the help, moderates the effect of the (non-)cash
incentive. It will work well in one context but can backfire in another.
According to relational incentive theory [21,29] people categorize the context in
which an interaction takes place into one of four relationship categories: common
sharing, authority ranking, equality matching, and market pricing. They adjust their
participation behavior and reward expectations according to the classified context. In
common sharing (CS), individuals consider their engagement as contributing to a
common goal and supporting the group to solve a pressing problem without asking for
returns because of shared beliefs, solidarity, and altruistic reasons. In authority ranking
(AR), individuals accept a hierarchical order. They engage in relationships to learn from
superiors, fulfill their duties as good citizens, or conform to the authorities. Equality
matching (EM) is characterized by reciprocity, balance, and tit-for-tat. Individuals engage
in, e.g., carpooling or dinner party invitations because they trust that others will
reciprocate at a later time. Market pricing (MP) refers to situations dominated by cost-
benefit calculations, where personal gain determines if one engages in an activity or not.
While the first three relationship patterns (CS, AR, EM) are social in nature, the MP
schemata is based on economic exchange. Thus, previous research suggests simplifying
the model and subsuming the four categories into two categories, social markets—
consisting of the CS, AR, and EM relationships, and monetary markets – referring to MP
[33]. They investigate the main effect of different market contexts and find that students
show higher intentions to help moving a sofa, spend more time in an online experiment,
and show higher efforts in solving a serious of puzzles depending on the cash or non-cash
incentives offered [33]. They conclude, while monetary markets are sensitive to
compensation, social ones are not. In monetary markets, effort is directly related to the
amount of compensation. In social markets, effort is shaped by altruism.
Based on this insight, we theorize that the same incentive will be perceived
differently depending on the market context and that market context will thus moderate
the effect of the incentive [29]. Specifically, we expect the effect of non-cash incentives
to weaken in monetary market contexts.
While for-profit organizations develop new solutions to stay competitive and
generate profits for their shareholders, non-profit organizations innovate to solve pressing
problems and create common goods that benefit everyone. We therefore suggest that for-
8profit contests be perceived as monetary markets, while non-profit contests be perceived
as social markets. When the incentive is in line with the market context (such as a cash
incentive in a for-profit setting) this should strengthen the effect of the incentive.
Conversely, when the incentive is misaligned with the market context (such as a non-cash
incentive in a for-profit setting), the effect of the incentive should weaken. Further, as
participants adjust their incentive preferences and behaviors according to the market
context, the for-profit status of the contest organizer may activate ideators’ extrinsic
motives and lead to expectations of cash. Alternatively, those engaging in non-profit
settings may not expect to get paid but may appreciate a non-cash reward like a gift or
praise. Non-cash prizes may in fact constitute a mismatch in a for-profit contest setting,
where organizers benefit economically from the crowd’s contribution while the ideators
receive only a non-cash prize. Ideators may expect a fair monetary compensation when
organizers generate successful returns [30]. Thus, we theorize:
H2 (moderator): Market context moderates the effect of cash and non-cash incentives on
a) quality and b) effort.
Multi-Study Overview
We conducted four studies (see Figure 2) to quantify incentive preferences in a non-profit
field study (Study 1), test the main effect of incentive choice (Study 2), investigate
whether market context moderates the effect of incentives on quality and effort (Study 3),
and finally explore preference heterogeneity as a boundary condition (Study 4). Together,
these four studies paint a more complete picture of how incentive choice and market
context collectively affect effort and idea quality in crowdsourcing contests.

9Study 1: Quantify Non-Cash Incentive Preferences in a Field
Experiment
Design and Empirical Setting
To quantify ideators’ incentive preferences and offer preliminary evidence for a main
effect of incentive choice, we set up the “Scraplab” crowdsourcing contest. It was hosted
on a leading contest platform (www.hyvecrowd.com). The contest dealt with up-cycling
and the goal was to create products out of recyclable materials instead of producing
waste. Since the contest contributes to the Sustainable Development Goals of the United
Nations and aims to create impact rather than increasing corporate profits, the context can
be classified as non-profit. This topic seemed to be appropriate as it does not require
specialized knowledge, skills, or familiarity with existing brands. Further, because
resource shortage affects everyone, anyone can have ideas on how to solve it.
The submission of an idea consisted of a visual design in the form of photographs, a
textual description, and a list of materials used (see Appendix 2 for sample designs). As
is common in crowdsourcing contests, ideators could make multiple idea submissions,
create a profile page to share personal information, interact with each other by
commenting on design submissions, provide feedback through ratings, and promote
designs by sharing them on Facebook.
The contest was designed as a rank-order tournament [43] in which the three highest-
rated ideas would receive prizes valued at 1,000€ (1st), 600€ (2nd), and 400€ (3rd).
During registration, participants were offered the option to choose among a cash prize
and five non-cash prizes of the same value. The non-cash prizes included, a donation to a
charity of choice (altruistic motives [34]); a short internship (same renumeration as the
cash prize); career advancement motive [41]; participation in a workshop to improve their
own design innovations (need for a solution [34] or a funded party with friends (hedonic
motives [5,9]). As the incentive question was optional, participants who didn’t select one
of the five options were assigned to the default cash incentive.
Recruiting and participants. To reach a large and global audience, we advertised the
design contest globally in various design and sustainability communities, including
design schools. The competition was open for submissions for ten weeks. During the
contest period, the website had 16,686 unique visitors (unique IP addresses). 1,205
participants registered and were exposed to the incentive-choice question during their
upfront registration. 924 participants (77%) answered the question and chose their
preferred incentive. 281 participants (23%) did not make a choice. 259 participants
submitted one or more ideas/designs (587 ideas in total) and thus are labeled as ideators.
Among the 259 ideators, 118 answered the optional incentive preference question while
141 did not and were automatically assigned to the default cash option. At the end of the
contest, three ideators were awarded prizes for their designs. Ideators from 64 different
countries participated in the contest. The highest concentration of ideators was from the
United States of America (48%) and most were female (75%).
Data Sources and Measures
10We used three main sources of data in our study: (1) registration data on ideators’
demographics, occupation, and preferred incentive; (2) log-file data from the online
platform running the contest to explore participants’ behavior; and (3) data from an
independent external consumer panel using experienced workers on Amazon Mechanical
Turk to assess the quality of design submissions. Appendix 3 shows descriptive statistics
and correlations of our individual-level measures.
Independent variables and controls. The key variable of interest is the ideators’
Incentive Preference, which was an optional question on the registration survey. The
question was not forced so that ideators could choose whether to select an incentive or
not. We focused our analysis on contrasting ideators who chose the cash prize from those
who chose any of the other non-cash prizes. Data on ideators’ gender was from the
registration survey, as well as imputed from the first names and profile pictures of
ideators where necessary.2 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data from each ideators’
current country of residence was collected using 2011 numbers from the World Bank. For
ideators with missing values for country of origin (50 instances), we substituted the GDP
sample mean [62].
Because the key outcome measure of interest in this study is the quality of ideas, it is
critical to control for ideators’ ability, which may affect the quality of their designs [42].
Ability is generally unobserved and difficult to capture reliably. As an imperfect measure,
we included a measure indicating whether an ideator is a professional designer.
Professional designers are expected to have relevant experience in design tasks like that
of our contest, by having previously engaged in design work full-time for an extended
period. Experience is probably the most widely used proxy for expertise [18]. Thus, based
on information that ideators provided during the registration procedure, we included an
ideator’s status as a professional designer as a proxy for expertise (1=professional
designer; 0=not professional designer).
Data from the online platform includes information on the time an ideator first
registered, and the number of designs, comments, and ratings he/she submitted. We
included controls for the number of Submitted Ideas, Submitted Comments, and
Submitted Ratings, as these provide ideators with the ability to learn from both their own
direct experience and from observing the work of others [60]. Lastly, we included a
control for the number of ideas that were already submitted to the contest just prior to the
signup of an ideator. The number of prior ideas is an easily observable signal to potential
contributors of how competitive a contest is. As such, it may affect ideators’ choice of
incentive.
Dependent variable. This is the quality of each ideator’s best idea. We followed
standard practice in ideation studies [38,66] and measured the dependent variable, Design
Quality, for all designs submitted to the contest. We used an outside panel that followed a
relative assessment technique [4]. We recruited an independent jury who were blind to
the research propositions. They were experienced workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk.
We collected five evaluations for each design, resulting in 2,927 ratings of each of the six
assessment items (17,562 ratings in total) from a total of 77 different raters (Appendix 2
2 Two researchers independently coded gender; discrepancies were discussed and resolved; 12 out of 125 instances of missing gender
information could not be coded and were subsequently excluded from the analysis.

analyzed how incentive choice affects ideators’ probability to become active
(Appendix 4).

effect of choice is complicated as the analysis needs to account for self-selection of the
assignments. We analyze our data using a Tobit-5 switching regression (this is also
known as the Roy model [59] to distinguish the cash vs. non-cash incentive effect from
the influence of choice (see Appendix 2 for details on the Tobit-5 model). To establish
whether there is main effect of offering a choice we need to establish two findings. First,
we need to determine whether there is a performance difference among ideators who
chose the cash vs. the non-cash incentive. Second, we need to examine whether the
correlation of the error terms of the self-selection component in the model are positively
correlated. A positive correlation would signify that ideators who chose the incentive
performed better than they would have in a hypothetical scenario in which they were
randomly assigned to that incentive. Regarding the first condition, we find systematic
performance differences between ideators who chose cash and those who chose a non-
cash prize. Specifically, we observe a significantly higher effect of the non-cash incentive
on idea quality compared to the cash incentive (direct incentive effects in Table 2; testing
for equal coefficients comparing 𝛽 = 3.6 to 𝛽 = 3.0; 𝜒((12) = 10.29; p <

10.001). Regarding the second condition, we find that the estimated correlation
coefficients between the error term of the selection equation and the outcome equations
(the r and r estimates in the table), are both large and significantly different from zero
1 2
(p < 0.001). Since r is positive and significantly different from zero, the model suggests
1
that individuals who chose the non-cash prize produced designs of higher quality (than a
random individual from the sample). Conversely, since r is negative and significantly
2
different from zero, the model suggests that ideators who chose a cash prize produced
designs of lower quality (than a random individual from the sample would have).

offering ideators a choice. This suggests an 11% increase in design quality from offering
ideators a choice of incentives compared with simply offering cash to everyone. That is,
using an econometric approach to a3ccount for self selection, the observational data from
13Study 1 provides preliminary evidence for a main effect of incentive choice on idea
quality supporting H1a. Since we do not know how much time ideators spent on creating
their upcyled designs, we cannot test hypothesis H1b (on effort) in Study 1.
Summary
Participants had diverse incentive preferences and chose both cash and non-cash prizes
when given the choice. While cash was the most popular choice, almost half of ideators
chose one of the non-cash options, and about one quarter preferred to not make a choice
at all (receiving the default cash option). We also find preliminary evidence that incentive
choice had a significant main effect on idea quality: Offering ideators a choice of
incentives is an effective strategy for contest organizers to unlock additional value
independent of the incentive offered, supporting H1a.
Study 2: Main Effect of Incentive Choice in Online Experiment with
Random Assignment
To explore the preliminary evidence of a main effect of incentive choice, Study 2 uses
random assignment to give some ideators a choice of incentives while others had no such
choice. Further, as the field study left unanswered why some participants did not actively
choose a prize, Study 2 also tests participants’ indifference between cash and non-cash
prizes as well as the decision to opt out of receiving any prize.
Method
Procedure. We implemented an online experiment that mirrored the task of an ideation
crowdsourcing contest (Figure 3). First, subjects completed a pre-treatment survey to
answer demographic questions, as well as a practice task (a standard “unusual uses”
creativity task [16], and answered three items from the Intrinsic Motivation Battery [51];
Cronbach’s 𝛼 = .9). Second, we performed a treatment manipulation in which subjects
were either randomly assigned a prize (“assigned” condition), were asked to choose a
prize (“choice” condition), or were not offered a prize (“control” condition). Third,
subjects completed the main ideation task. Fourth, we used an external panel to evaluate
idea quality.

The main ideation task asked subjects to submit ideas to reduce water consumption,
which they entered through a free-form text field. Again, as in Study 1, the context can be
classified as non-profit as the ideation task contributes to the Sustainable Development
Goals and aims to create impact rather than increase corporate profits. In addition to the
idea itself, we also measured effort in terms of time (in seconds) that participants devoted
to submitting their idea.3 Individuals could type as many ideas as they wanted (in
situations where multiple ideas were submitted, we calculated the overall effort as the
total number of seconds spent entering all of the ideas).
Recruiting. To recruit participants, we advertised the experiment on the Volunteer
Science platform, an online laboratory for experiments in social psychology. We
performed no specific recruiting to attract participants for our study (see [59] for details
and validation of the Volunteer Science platform).
Treatments. All subjects competed either for no prize at all, a $50 cash prize, or a
$50 donation to a charity of their choice. Participation was entirely voluntary and no
additional compensation (such as a flat show-up fee) was paid. The treatment
manipulation was whether the prize was randomly assigned or whether the subject got to
choose what the prize was. We implemented three alternative versions of the choice
treatment manipulation to explore the kinds of choice options contest designers may
consider:
1. Assigned no prize (control condition)
2. Assigned a $50 cash prize (i.e., no choice offered)
3. Assigned a $50 donation to a charity of choice (i.e., no choice offered)
4. Choice between either a $50 cash prize or a $50 donation
5. Choice between either $50 cash or a $50 donation, measured on a 7-point Likert
scale. We treated the central values (3, 4, 5) as indicating indifference between cash
and non-cash incentives, while we treated strong (1) and weak (2) preference for cash
as cash and strong (7) and weak (6) preference for non-cash as non-cash. We
informed ideators that their reward would be determined randomly using the
proportions of their choice (i.e., 50:50 chance between cash and non-cash if they
chose the middle point “4” on the Likert scale; 43:57 chance if they chose “5” and so
on).
6. Choice between either accepting a $50 cash prize or opting out of prizes entirely.
We performed (streaming) random assignment of participants to treatment conditions
as is common in online experiments where the total number of participants is not known
ex ante. We assigned more ideators to the choice conditions to reflect the fact that these
conditions have several nested sub-conditions.
Sample and Measures. We stopped the experiment after 40 days, at which point 221
3 We also implemented a mechanism to detect if they would simply copy & paste text into the text form (none
did).
15individuals had completed it and 208 ideas had been submitted (e.g., we removed ideators
who submitted ideas such as “I don’t know;” Appendix 6). Four individuals dropped out
after having been assigned to a treatment condition. The dropout was not correlated with
treatment condition (𝜒((5) = 4.78). Women and men participated in equal proportion
(51% female) with equal proportion in each treatment (𝜒((5) = 2.06). Participants were
young (94% reported age between 18-24) and mostly from the USA (92%).
We measure idea quality using Amabile’s Consensual Assessment Technique from
an outside panel recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk, following the same method
and procedure as in Study 1. We collected 1,440 quality ratings in total from 93 different
raters who performed an average of 15.5 ratings each. Inter-coder reliability is excellent
(0.836); Cronbach’s alpha is good (0.84).
Results
Quantifying incentive preferences. Again, we find heterogeneous incentive preferences:
56% chose the cash incentive, and 44% the donation incentive when given a choice (see
Appendix 6). Individual-level characteristics like gender, age, home country, or intrinsic
motivation are no significant predictors of incentive preference. The field study did not
address whether ideators may simply have been indifferent to our prize options, so we
also explored whether ideators would opt-out or are indifferent. When given the option to
forgo a cash prize, 29% of participants chose to opt out. We find that 37% of individuals
who were given a choice between cash and non-cash indicated that they were indifferent
between the two (they selected one of the middle points on the Likert-scale).
Main effect of incentive choice on quality and effort. We used OLS regression to
analyze the main effect of incentive choice on idea quality and a negative binomial
regression for the effects on effort (Table 3). This analysis contrasts the two levels of the
treatment conditions of offering a choice vs. assigning a fixed incentive to ideators. First,
we find that offering ideators a choice, per se, improved idea quality (Model 1: β = .17;
marginally significant at p = 0.076; supportting H1a) but not effort (Model 3: β = .263;
n.s.; rejecting H1b). This suggests that incentive choice increases idea quality by 6.6%.
To better understand the main effect of incentive choice, it is crucial to understand
which incentives are most effective when chosen. We explore this through the interaction
between the choice treatment (choice vs. assigned) and the incentive. The interaction
between choice and cash shows a significant negative effect on idea quality (β = -.46;
p < 0.05). We also find a significant interaction between choice and the non-cash
incentive on effort (β = .85; p < 0.001). This suggests that the effectiveness of incentives
on both idea quality and effort is moderated by the form in which incentives are delivered
such that choice decreases the effect of cash incentives on idea quality and increases the
effect of non-cash incentives on effort.

Summary
We find a significant main effect showing that choice improves idea quality (confiming
H1a) but not effort (no support for H1b). While the coefficient for the main effect of
choice on effort is insignificant, the direction of the effect is positive. We find that choice
significantly reduces the effectivness of cash incentives on quality and amplifies the
positive effect of the non-cash incentive on effort.
Study 3: Moderator of For-Profit and Non-Profit Context
In Study 3, we explore if market context moderates the effect of incentives on quality and
effort. We conducted a crowdsourcing contest of a typical for-profit organization to
generate ideas that could be commercialized to ensure future profits. To create a realistic
experiment, we replicated the ideation task of the Intel Future Contest, a real-world
ideation challenge sponsored by Intel. In that contest, Intel solicited ideas for new
products or services around a new technology [55]. This technology aims to allow the
building of a new generation of smart devices (e.g., smart wearable technology) and
9
applications. The task provided background information on the new technology adapted
from the Intel Future Contest and then we asked ideators to provide information on
17product features, benefits, uses, and design proposals. We advertised an open call to a
public audience on Craigslist, Reddit, Facebook, and various other technology-related
communities and blogs.
Method
Procedure. We implemented an online experiment which randomly assigned ideators
following the same general setup as in Study 2. The design is a 2 (incentive: cash, non-
cash) × 2 (choice: choice, assigned) × 2 (context: for-profit, non-profit) between-subject
study, resulting in six treatment conditions (Appendix 7). We manipulated market context
by framing the ideation task as being solicited by either a for-profit or non-profit
organization. The for-profit condition framed the ideation task as “a for-profit
multinational corporation wants to develop a for-profit product or service”, while the
non-profit condition solicited ideas for “a non-profit research organization wants to
develop a non-profit product or service.”
To increase the stakes compared to Study 2, we increased the prize money to $1,000,
split as follows: $500 for 1st prize, $300 for 2nd prize, and $200 for 3rd prize. We
performed (streaming) random assignment of participants to treatment conditions as is
common in online experiments where the total number of participants is not known ex
ante. We stopped the experiment after four weeks. The study was pre-registered before
data collection began (https://osf.io/8qw7t/).
Measures. We measured the effort in seconds spent on the ideation task. Following
the same procedure as in the other studies, we collected data to measure idea quality from
an outside panel recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk. We collected 770 ratings of
quality from 46 different raters who performed an average of 17 ratings each and five
ratings per idea. Inter-coder reliability is excellent (0.77); Cronbach’s alpha is good
(0.80).
Results
A total of 120 ideators completed the experiment and submitted at least one idea
(153 ideas were submitted in total). In a post-experiment self-report question, the
manipulation of the profit motive was effective with 76% of ideators correctly recalling
the profit structure of the organization sponsoring the contest (i.e., for-profit vs. non-
profit).
Quantifying incentive preferences across market contexts. Despite qualitatitive
differences, we find no statistically significant difference of preference for cash or non-
cash incentives between for-profit and non-profit contexts (Appendix 8, Model 2). In the
non-profit context, 31% chose the non-cash incentive compared to 23% in the for-profit
context. Within the for-profit context, a simple for equal proportion indicates that cash is
the significantly more popular choice (cash is significantly more popular than non-cash; p
= 0.001). There is no significant difference within the non-profit context.
Moderating effect of market context. We find no significant direct effect of market
context on quality (Table 4: Model 1; β = -.06; n.s.) but a significant effect on effort
(Model 6; β = -.41; p < 0.05). We find no significant moderation effect between market
18context and incentives for quality (Model 4; β = -.21; n.s.). However, the for-profit
context significantly reduces the effect of non-cash incentives on effort (Model 9; β = -
.75; p < 0.05). That is, we find evidence that market context moderates the effect of
incentives on effort (H2b) but not quality (H2a).

ouinrt eervaicdtieonncteer msutghgatecsatns btheaets ttihmea tmeda.in effect of offering ideators a choice derives from
achieving improved fit between ideators’ preferred incentive and the incentive they
actually receive (as opposed to the direct effect of simply asking them to reveal their
preference). That is, actually observing diverse incentive preferences in the population
may be crucial for the main effect of ince6ntive choice to unfold. This is important
because over time some online platforms may evolve an environment in which
individuals have homogeneous incentive preferences despite representing diverse
19populations in terms of gender, home country, and economic background. In this study,
we test this boundary condition by repeating the basic setup from Study 2, using a sample
of ideators drawn from a population of gig workers narrowly focused on earning income.
We recruited participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), an online labor market
Here, we expect participating workers to have a homogeneous preference for cash as
transactions in the online labor market are based on strict market relationships.
Prior research has shown that AMT workers are predominantly motivated by
financial incentives [49]. For example, they often give themselves daily or weekly quotas
of how much money they want to earn working on the AMT platform. If we find that the
majority of ideators make the same choice and we find no main effect of incentive
choice, this suggests that heterogeneous incentive preferences are an important boundary
condition to realize a positive direct effect of incentive choice.
Method
Procedure. We recruited 160 workers from the AMT online labor market. Workers were
compensated with a $1 “show-up” fee and randomly assigned to the same ideation task
and treatment conditions from Study 2: no prize (N=21), cash (N=20), non-cash (N=29),
a choice between cash and non-cash (N=37), and a choice between cash and opt out
(N=46).
Results
Quantifying incentive preferences. As predicted, we find that participants drawn from
AMT showed no interest in non-cash prizes whatsoever (Appendix 9). Zero participants
chose the non-cash prize in the cash/non-cash condition (out of 29) and only two (out of
46) chose to opt out.
Main effect of incentive choice on quality and effort. We used OLS regression to
explore the incentive and choice effects on idea quality and a negative binomial
regression for the effects on effort. Notice that we only included the cash, assigned non-
cash, and no-prize control groups in our sample, and omitted the “opt out” and “chose
non-cash” groups due to the small number of individuals making those choices. We find
no significant main effect of offering a choice on either quality (Table 5: Model 1; β = .1;
n.s.) or effort (Model 2; β = -.02; n.s.), indicating that the mere choice of the preferred
cash option – without interest in other incentive options – offered no benefit and did not
lead to increased performance. To directly test if increased agency and self-determination
is a plausible mechanism behind the choice effect, we added the intrinsic motivation
battery to the post-experiment survey. We find no difference in intrinsic motivation
between individuals who chose cash compared to those who were assigned cash (t = .69;
d.f. = 31.14; p = .50), suggesting that simply asking cash motivated individuals to reveal
their cash motivation does not itself lead to increased motivation.
20Table 5. Study 4 – Regression analysis of AMT sample. Note that we do not estimate coefficients for the small
number of ideators who chose non-cash or were indifferent as those groups are too small for a meaningful
analysis. Consequently, Choice: Yes implies Prize: Cash and there is no separate interaction term that can be
estimated.

improved incentive-preference fit is driving mechanism.
The field study (Study 1) and the randomized lab experiment (Study 2) both provide
evidence for the main effect of offering a choice on idea quality (not effort; both those studies
were set in a non-profit context). Study 3 finds that market context moderates the effect of
incentives on effort (but not idea quality). One possible explanation for the null-effect on
quality may be that idea quality in creative settings only partially depends on effort or it may
simply be a result of low statistical power (while not statistically significant, the regression
coefficient for quality points in the same direction as that for effort). Ideators exerted less
effort in for-profit settings than in non-profit settings overall and even less when the for-profit
setting is paired with a non-cash incentive. Finally, we point to an important boundary
condition (Study 4): If ideators have uniform incentive preferences for cash such as gig
workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk, offering a choice of incentives has no effect. The lack
of a direct effect of choice per se, suggests that the benefit arises from the improved matching
between incentive preference and the incentive being offered. As a result, we theorize that the
gains from offering a choice do not arise from a feeling of agency but instead from improved
sorting of preferences to incentives. Without heterogeneous incentive preferences, there is no
room for gains from sorting of preferences to actual incentive. This suggests that the strength
of the effect of offering a choice depends both on the diversity of ideators’ incentive
preferences and the diversity of incentives being offered to maximize this sorting effect.
Across our four studies, personal characteristics such as gender, economic background, and
intrinsic motivation served only as weak proxies for incentive preferences while social value
orientation emerged as a strong predictor in Study 3.
Our findings make three main contributions to theory. First, past work on crowdsourcing
design focused on contest design aspects like prize structures [46,54,64], number of
contestants [11], and entry barriers [26]. By contrast, we establish that incentive choice is a
pivotal aspect of incentive design that is little understood [53] and are the first to shed light on
the underlying mechanism why it may work. Our study explains why offering ideators a
22choice of incentives per se can improve performance. We theorize that offering a choice
improves creative performance in crowdsourcing contests because it improves the incentive-
preference fit which increases effort and performance rather than an increased sense of
autonomy and sense of control [15]. This connects with the idea of incentive choice in
research on mass customization, where customers self-configure products that match their
preferences rather than choose standardized products [22]. Our study is the first to shed light
on the mechanism behind the effectiveness of incentive choice and its important boundary
conditions. Outside crowdsourcing, [14,57] are notable exceptions that explored incentive
choice in a lab experiment giving participants a choice between fixed and performance-based
pay.
We contribute to work on crowdsourcing design by explicating an important boundary
condition: offering a choice is ineffective when the incentive preferences in the target
population are homogeneous. Incentive preferences may be homogeneous despite diverse
geographic and economic background when recruiting ideators from online labor markets
such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (see Study 4). Further, the sorting effect seems to
strengthen when many attractive incentive options are offered (Study 1; c.f. [68]).
Additionally, ideators may enjoy various benefits [9] and may hence also be rather indifferent
to the available incentive options. Thus, forcing participants to reveal their preferences by
choosing their preferred incentive may only increase their burden and not offer additional
value [50]. Incentive choice may further consider an opt-out option (see Study 2) as
participants may prefer to forgo any incentive rather than accept an incentive that, in their
eyes, does not match their demonstrated performance [21].
Second, our study contributes to a better understanding of incentives in different
market contexts. While crowdsourcing contests are used equally in for-profit vs. non-
profit market contexts, existing research has studied the direct effect of cash vs. non-cash
incentives [6,24], but not considered market context as a moderator. Our study fills this
gap and extends received knowledge that incentives can sometimes backfire when they
are misaligned with the market context in which they are used [29,65]. We show that
incentive preference and its effect on quality and effort is not only influenced by individual’s
motives and personal characteristics, but also market context. Researchers [34] have applied
Fiske’s relationship theory to explain the signaling effect of incentives and their influence on
effort [63], and empirical studies have referred to different effects of incentives in for-profit
and non-profit contexts [12,16]. However, no one has yet considered the classification of
context as a monetary market (for-profit) vs. social market (non-profit) as an important
moderator for predicting incentive preference and its effect on quality and effort.
Third, we expand on previous research that has identified a variety of intrinsic and
extrinsic reasons for why individuals engage in crowdsourcing contests [1,8,11,23,45] by
quantifying of the extent to which this this occurs and demonstrating that individuals not only
have diverse preferences but actually choose different incentives when given the choice.
While our results are consistent with past research showing that cash is generally the most
prevalent single incentive due to its high option value [36], in some settings almost half prefer
non-cash incentives. Our work is one of the first to validate various incentive preferences in a
field setting. This emphasizes the importance of heterogeneous incentives not only as a niche
aspect but a core driver of motivation to participate in crowdsourcing contests. This insight
opens opportunities to improve contest design by considering alternative incentives. We also
23determine that ideators not only have diverse incentive preferences but sometimes even prefer
to opt out of receiving any incentives and sometimes are indifferent, thus suggesting entirely
new forms of incentives to consider. These findings emphasize the existing literature that it is
not easy to offer an appropriate incentive upfront [48,56] and providing incentive choice may
be useful.
Managerial Implications
Our research has four practical implications for open innovation managers to design more
effective incentive regimes. First, offering a choice of incentives may increase the
effectiveness of incentives in crowdsourcing contests, especially when incentive preferences
are diverse and a set of suitable non-cash incentives are available. Offering a choice can
alleviate the concern that managers may not know what the most desirable incentive is and
may worry about missing out if cash is not offered. Second, the incentive choice should be
implemented as an optional choice with a clearly defined cash default option to cater to
ideators who may be indifferent. This choice allows contest organizers to offer unique and
unexpected incentives that may be very effective in special contexts (e.g., NASA offering a
low value artifact like a sticker mentioning “flown in space”; [9,63]). Third, the accentuation
of a non-profit context (social market) matters. Social markets can positively affect
participants’ level of effort. Thus, crowdsourcing contests in social markets should underline
their social character. Fourth, heterogeneous incentive preferences may over time vanish as
online platforms specialize and evolve to cater to a more homogeneous user group (e.g.,
AMT). Crowdsourcing platforms must be aware that if they heavily rely on cash as their
standard incentive, it will not be surprising that their community expects cash. Conversely,
offering non-cash incentives and hosting contests for a variety of market contexts can be a
means to attract heterogeneous ideators, which may improve idea quality throughout the
platform.
Limitations and Future Research
Our findings are not without limitations. Although gathered in various setups and under
realistic conditions, further research is required to establish the dimensions in which they
generalize. Our strongest findings in favor of non-cash incentives come from the field data in
Study 1. This study was set in a non-profit context and those results may not fully generalize
to for-profit settings despite our insights from Studies 2-4. Future research could evaluate if
similar incentive preferences persist in crowdsourcing contests in for-profit contexts. While
our results are consistent in regards to effect of incentives, choice, and context, more research
is required to investigate the effect in additional settings and to enhance the overall
applicability of our conclusions. In addition, numerous new areas necessitate further
investigation, including design of choice options, the effect of indifference, the offering of
incentive bundles, the effect of incentive opt out, and the conditions that create a social
market character.
Further, exploring how incentives over time lead to homogeneous preferences and
adjusted behaviors, e.g., those found at AMT, would be illuminating. Additionally, our study
employed prize purses that are commonly used in current reserach. Higher prizes may
24lead to different outcomes and different incentive choices. In particular, we expect
incentives to function differently in crowdsourcing contests compared with grand
challenges like NASA’s $1M CO2 Conversion Challenge or the $10M Ansari X-Prize for
Suborbital Flight. We speculate that ideators would be much less likely to either forgo
incentives or choose a non-cash option if the stakes are very high. Consequently, the full
range of ideators’ sensitivity to prize levels remains an open question. Our analysis also
focused on shifts in the mean quality of ideas due to selection and treatment effects.
However, sometimes shifts in maximum quality are more important than shifts in mean
quality, especially in rank-order.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this research significantly advances our understanding of incentive design in
crowdsourcing contests, highlighting the importance of offering a choice between cash and
non-cash incentives to match diverse ideators preferences. It underscores the role of market
context which moderates the effectiveness of these incentives and reveals that personal
characteristics are less indicative of preference than previously thought. The findings open
new pathways for designing more effective crowdsourcing contests, emphasizing the need for
flexibility and customization of incentives to cater to diverse participant motives and market
contexts.

symbolic) choice impacts solution quality.
Cappa et al. empirically test if two different types of rewards –
[6] No Yes Yes Yes No No monetary and social rewards – increase the number of
contributions in crowdsourcing.
Eisenberger and Rhoades examined unrewarded and rewarded
[12] No Yes Yes No No No
creativity training and its impact on creative task performance.
Heymann and Ariely test the relationship between forms of
compensation (cash vs. token), the levels of payment (no, low,
[20] No Yes Yes No Yes No
and medium), and the resulting effort expended in monetary and
social markets.
Sittenthaler and Mohen employs an experiment to test the impact
[31] No Yes Yes No No No of monetary, non-monetary, and a combination of monetary and
non-monetary incentives on performance.
The authors test incentives and their impact on contest
[5] No No Yes Yes Yes No performance in high and low-uncertainty problems with greater

Erat and Gneezy empirically test whether piece-rate and competitive incentives affect creativity, and if
[14] No No Yes No No No so, how the incentive effect depends on different types – and not merely the presence – of extrinsic

Eisenberger and Selbst investigate why behaviorists and cognitive
[13] No No Yes No No No oriented investigators show opposite conclusions about reward’s
effects on creativity.
The authors examine the effect of reward on children’s and adults’

Amabile test the creativity motivation hypothesis by investigating
[2] No No Yes No No No the effects of a common extrinsic constraint – competing for prizes
– on children’s artistic creativity in a field setting.
Pinder test additivity versus non-additivity of intrinsic and extrinsic

Eder and Manso test in a controlled experimental setting the effects
[11] No No Yes No No No of different incentives schemes (e.g. fixed wage, pay for
performance, exploration) on innovation and performance.
The authors evaluate in a series of laboratory experiments the fixed

as low a cost as possible under various market conditions.
Deci and Cascio test changes in intrinsic motivation as a function of

negative feedback and threats.
Our review categorizes the studies along incentives and choice. In addition, we classify the study settings (creativity in crowdsourcing
vs. other settings), how the data was gathered (observational vs. experimental data design), and the context setting (for-profit vs. non-
profit). While our review does not claim to be exhaustive it covers the most relevant and actual studies.

4Construction of Dependent Variable: In this section we provide additional details how
we constructed the baseline rating of design quality. We measure the dependent variable,
Design Quality, for all designs submitted to the contest using the Consensual Assessment
Technique (CAT; Amabile, 1982). We recruited an independent jury that was blind to the
research hypotheses from reliable and experienced workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk. 1
This panel evaluated each product based on the following six dimensions: (1)
creativity, (2) novel use of materials (e.g., materials are used in a unique way), (3) novel
association (e.g., unique or unusual association with existing products or objects), (4)
variation of materials used (e.g., different materials, number of colors, originality), (5) level
of detail and complexity (e.g., of the design or decoration), and (6) appearance (i.e., how
good it would look in a home or office).
Workers were instructed to make relative assessments based on their own definition
of creativity [2]. As part of the instructions, workers were shown a grid of nine randomly
selected designs to facilitate this relative assessment. Workers evaluated designs in random
order and for each design, the assessment items were arranged in random order. We
collected five evaluations for each design, resulting in 2,927 ratings of each of the six
assessment items (17,562 ratings in total) from a total of 77 different raters. We apply the
technique suggested by (Ipeirotis, Provost, and Wang 2010) to identify and then remove
unreliable workers. The technique identified 17 low-quality raters who submitted ratings
with extremely low information content (e.g., rating completely at random or submitting
1 AMT offers a mechanism to restrict the pool of eligible workers using various qualifications. We
restricted our task to workers with the following qualifications:
• Approval rate for all prior tasks greater than or equal to 99%
• Number of tasks approved greater than or equal to 10,000.
That is, selecting experienced workers is nothing that we did specifically, but is a feature directly
available on AMT.
5identical ratings for all five items). These raters collectively submitted 432 ratings (15%).
After cleaning the ratings from low-quality raters, 2,495 ratings remain (that is, 14,970
ratings in total), with an average of 4.3 ratings per design and 42 ratings per rater.2 We paid
workers on average $4.20 for their effort.
The key premise of a crowdsourcing contest is to attract submissions from a diverse pool
of participants [23]. Hence, crowdsourcing contests are most effective when they are geared
toward reaching out to outsiders to solicit creative ideas. Research has now shown that 1)
online panels such as those from Amazon Mechanical Turk are appropriate [34], 2) expertise
does not significantly affect the quality of assessments [30], 3) high correlation exists between
the assessments from experts and laypeople across different evaluation methods [4], and 4)
assessments from panels of consumers can be even better than expert panels [24]. Overall, we
conceptualize the performance of ideators in crowdsourcing idea contests as the quality of the
best idea that an individual submits, rather than effort (e.g., measure in time spent on the task
or the length of the submitted idea).
Prior research on ideation has often defined performance as the average quality of ideas
or the number of ideas generated by an individual, ignoring that most organizations seek a
few great ideas [17]. Consequently, in case an ideator made multiple design submissions, we
use the quality of the ideator’s best submission. That is, at the individual level, the
performance of an ideator is then measured as the quality of the best idea that an individual
submitted. A focus on ideators’ best idea rather than average idea quality is also more
consistent with the nature of a rank-order tournament in which prizes are only awarded to the
2 Robustness tests including all ratings and not dropping low-quality raters do not substantively
change our conclusions but explained variance (R2) is lower, supporting the notion that low-quality raters
added only noise.

Cronbach’s alpha of 0.9 indicates high internal consistency of the six assessment items.
Intercoder reliability ICC (2,k) for the aggregated scale (all six items) is 0.70 indicating good
inter-rater agreement [7]. Individual item ICC (2,k) range from 0.59 to 0.66. The quality of
ideas, i.e., their creativity, is critically important for an innovation’s success and ultimately
market success [24] and is thus most important from a managerial perspective.
3 We do perform robustness tests using an ideator’s average quality instead and find substantively similar results. See section on robustness tests
for more details.
7Sample Designs – We show example designs submitted to the consumer innovation
contest.
8Robustness Tests Using Alternative Measures of Quality: Since the goal in rank order
contests is to win the contest, we focused the analyses presented in the main paper on the
quality of the best idea submitted by an ideator. We show correlation coefficients of three
different quality measures in the table below and find substantively similar results for any of the
three quality measures. Not surprisingly, the maximum and mean quality are highly correlated
(𝜌 = 0.88; p < .001). We find substantively similar results using average quality as the
dependent variable.

chose an incentive show a lower probability to submit an idea 12.8% (N=118) than those 23%
(N=281) participants who made no choice. No-choice participants show a much higher
probability to submit an idea (50%, 2N=140; Table 1 in the main text).
To further explore the effect of incentive choice on becoming active, we conducted a
bivariate probit model [18]. This model allowed us to further explore the effect of the sequential
choice of incentive followed by the choice to exert effort and make a submission. The analysis
shows that choice has a positive effect on becoming active when controlling for participants’
individual characteristics. Personal characteristics – high-income country (β = -.54; p < 0.01),
western background (β = -.28; p < 0.05), and female (β = - .43; p < 0.01) – are strongly
negatively correlated with submitting a design. Controlling for these characteristics reveals a
positive effect of choosing an incentive (β = .62; p < 0.05) and becoming active. Contrary to our
descriptive observation, we find that choice significantly increases the likelihood of becoming
active by 38.7%.
