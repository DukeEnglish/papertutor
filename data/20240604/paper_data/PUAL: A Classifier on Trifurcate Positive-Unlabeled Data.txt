Abstract: Positive-unlabeled (PU) learning aims to train a classifier using the data
containing only labeled-positive instances and unlabeled instances. However, existing
PU learning methods are generally hard to achieve satisfactory performance on tri-
furcate data, where the positive instances distribute on both sides of the negative
instances. To address this issue, firstly we propose a PU classifier with asymmetric
loss (PUAL), by introducing a structure of asymmetric loss on positive instances into
the objective function of the global and local learning classifier. Then we develop a
kernel-based algorithm to enable PUAL to obtain non-linear decision boundary. We
show that, through experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets, PUAL
can achieve satisfactory classification on trifurcate data.
1 Introduction
PU learning is to train a classifier from PU data, which only contain labeled-positive
instances and unlabeled instances, i.e., the PU data lack labeled-negative instances
for training. Recently, there are more and more PU data occurring in practice,
such as deceptive review detection [1], text categorization [2] and remote sensing
classification [3, 4].

natural way to deal with this issue is topick the instances highly likely to be negative
from the unlabeled set and treat them as negative; then the obtained dataset will
containlabeled-positive,labeled-negativeandunlabeledinstances;andthusfinallyPU
learningcanbeconvertedtoclassicalsemi-supervisedlearning.Themethodsfollowing
thisideaareoftenreferredtoastwo-stepmethods[5–12],whichcanalsobegeneralized
to have more steps of further iterative training [13–17].
However, the accuracy of such a multi-step method relies heavily on the accuracy
of the algorithm applied in the first step to pick reliable negative instances [18]. This
drawback motivated studies to train a PU classifier in a single step, termed one-step
methods,whichcanbefurthercategorizedintoinconsistentPUlearningmethodsand
consistentPUlearningmethods,dependingoniftheobjectivefunctionisaconsistent
estimator of an expected loss to classify an unknown instance frorm the population.
A pioneer consistent PU learning method is the unbiased PU learning (uPU) [19].
Subsequently, the non-negative PU learning (nnPU) [20] was proposed by taking the
absolute value of the estimated average loss on the negative set in the objective func-
tion of uPU for better convergence of the classifier training. Furthermore, imbalanced
nnPU (imbalancednnPU) [21] was proposed to address imbalanced PU training set.
Nevertheless, the training of the consistent methods often required more information
out of the PU dataset, e.g., the class prior or the distribution of population.
Early attempt of the inconsistent PU learning methods was the biased support
vector machine (BSVM) [22] based on the classic supervised support vector machine
(SVM)[23],assigningahighweighttotheaveragelossofthelabeled-positiveinstances
andalowweighttotheaveragelossoftheunlabeledinstancesintheobjectivefunction.
Subsequently, weighted unlabeled samples SVM (WUS-SVM) [24] was proposed to
assign a distinct weight to each of the unlabeled instances according to the likelihood
of this unlabeled instance to be negative. Then, the biased least squares SVM (BLS-
SVM) was proposed in [25]. It replaces the hinge loss with the squared loss in the
objectiveofBSVMincasethattoomuchimportanceisgiventotheunlabeled-positive
instancestreatedasnegativeduringthetrainingofclassifier.Thenthelocalconstraint
wasintroducedtotheobjectivefunctionofBLS-SVMin[26],encouragingtheinstances
to be classified into the same class as its neighborhoods and the proposed method
is called the global and local learning classifier (GLLC). Moreover, the large-margin
label-calibrated SVM (LLSVM) [27] was proposed to further alleviate the bias by
introducingthehatlosstotheobjectivefunction,wherethehatlossmeasuresthegap
between the inverse tangent of the predictive score function (without intercept) and
a certain threshold.
However, for trifurcate data where the positive set is roughly constituted by two
subsetsdistributingonbothsidesofnegativeinstances,existingPUlearningmethods
areusuallyhardtoachievesatisfactoryperformance.AnexampleofthetrifurcatePU
datasets is illustrated in Fig. 1 by the 2-dimensional projection with the t-distributed
stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) [28] of dataset Wireless Indoor Localization
(wifi) [29].
A classifier with non-linear decision boundary is needed for the classification of
trifurcate datasets. However, when we apply kernel trick to obtain the non-linear

pattern illustrated in Fig. 2, where the distances from the two positive subsets to the

the ideal decision boundary.
The aim of applying the squared loss in the objective function of GLLC was to
ensuretheimportancegiventotheunlabeled-positiveinstancestobenegativesupport
vectors to be lower than the importance given to unlabeled-negative instances to be

not penalise the instances lying on the correct side of the margin, if the hinge loss is

the ideal decision boundary will not generate any wrong penalty.

2.1 BSVM
InordertoenableSVMtohandlePUclassification,BSVM[22]treatsalltheunlabeled
instances as negative and assigns the loss of labeled-positive instances and the loss
of unlabeled instances with different weights in the objective function. BSVM trains
classifiers by solving the following objective function:

2.2 BLS-SVM
One weakness of BSVM is that sometimes the hinge loss in the objective function
of BSVM in Equation (2) selects more unlabeled-positive instances than unlabeled-
negative instances tobe the support vectors for thenegativeclass, which constructs a
decision boundary tending to misclassify the unlabeled-positive instances as negative.
This is more likely to happen when there are many unlabeled-positive instances close
to the unlabeled negative instances.
To deal with this issue, BLS-SVM was proposed by [25] to force all training
instances to contribute to the construction of the decision boundary of the trained
SVM by solving the following optimization problem:
λ
min βTβ+C [1 −(X β+1 β )]T[1 −(X β+1 β )]
β,β02 p p [p] p 0 p [p] p 0 (3)
+C [1 +(X β+1 β )]T[1 +(X β+1 β )],
u u [u] u 0 u [u] u 0
where the squared loss replaces the hinge loss in BSVM on both labeled-positive
set and unlabeled set. The objective function of BLS-SVM makes all the instances
contribute to the construction of the decision boundary hence the importance given
to the unlabeled-positive instances treated as negative is restricted [30].
2.3 GLLC
The similarities between a training instance and its neighbors can also be treated as
a factor for classification, the idea of which is named local learning [31]. It is noted
that the gap between PU learning and classical supervised learning on accuracy can
be mitigated via GLLC [26], which is a combination of BLS-SVM and local learning.
5The objective function of GLLC is given as

3 Methodology
3.1 PUAL with Linear Decision Boundary
3.1.1 Objective Function
As discussed in Section 1, we propose to apply the hinge loss to the labeled-positive
instances,soastoimposenopenaltytotheinstancescorrectlyclassifiedbutfaraway
from the ideal decision boundary. Meanwhile, the squared loss needs to be applied to
the unlabeled instances in case that too much importance is given to the unlabeled-
positive instances treated as negative during the training of the classifier. Hence we
propose a structure of asymmetric loss on positive instances to revise GLLC, so that
the new method PUAL is able to address the issue of classification of trifurcate PU
data. Moreover, a local constraint term of similarity is helpful for PU classification.
Therefore, the unconstrained optimization problem of PUAL can be formulated as

However, the hinge loss term 1T[1 −(X β+1 β )] in the objective function
p p [p] p 0 +
of PUAL in Equation (7) is not always differentiable in the feasible region of the
6optimization, bringing difficulty to applying the gradient descent directly. To find an
alternative way for solving PUAL, the following reformulation of Equation (7) can be
considered:

3.1.2 Parameter Estimation
The convex objective function in Equation (8) can be regarded as the sum of the

fewer iterations than the gradient descent. Hence, we adopt it here.

3.2 PUAL with Non-Linear Decision Boundary
In this section, we develop a kernel-based algorithm to enable PUAL to have non-
linear decision boundary, so that PUAL can be applied on the non-linear separable
datasets including trifurcate PU datasets. The techniques applied in this section are
similar to many previous methods [26, 35–37].
3.2.1 Objective Function
Suppose ϕ(x) ∈ Rr×1 be a mapping of the instance vector x. Then let ϕ(X ) ∈
[k]
Rnk×r,k = p,u,pu be the mapping of the original data matrix X [k]. The ith row of
ϕ(X ) is ϕ(x )T. According to Equations (12) and (13), using ϕ(X ) as features
[k] i [k]
matrix instead of X for the training of PUAL, we can find the following necessary

Then, according to the closure properties in Theorem 1, we can obtain

4.1.2 Training-Test Split for the Synthetic PU Datasets
It should be noted that both GLLC and PUAL can be applied on the datasets sam-
pled from either single-training-set scenario [39] or case-control scenario [19] as we
set the suitable metric for hyper-parameter tuning in practice. More specifically, the
case-control scenario indicates that the unlabeled training set can be regarded to be
i.i.d.sampledfromthepopulation,whilethesingle-training-setscenarioindicatesthat
the whole training set can be regarded to be i.i.d. sampled from the population. In
this case, for more intuitive comparison, we split each of the synthetic dataset gener-
ated in Section 4.1.1 to construct the PU training and test sets consistent with the
single-training-set scenario by the following two steps:
1. Firstly, to split the dataset into a training set and a test set, 70% of the instances
inthesimplesyntheticdatasetobtainedinSection4.1.1wererandomlyselectedas
the training set while the test set was constituted by the rest 30% instances.
122. Secondly, to construct the labeled-positive set and unlabeled-set for training, 25%
of the positive instances in the above obtained training set were randomly selected
toformthelabeled-positivesetfortraining.Therestofthepositiveinstanceswere
mixed with the negative set, contributing to the unlabeled set for training.
Then 25 pairs of PU training set and test set were obtained.
4.1.3 Model Setting
We note that the real value of F1-score on the training dataset is not accessible if we
do not use the label information during model training. Therefore, by fixing C to 1
p
and the number K of the nearest neighbors to 5, C , λ, σ in the objective functions
u
of PUAL and GLLC were determined by 4-fold cross-validation (CV), which reached
the highest average PUF-score proposed in [40] on the validation sets. PUF-score is
similar to F1-score and can be directly obtained from PU data:
recall2
PUF-score= , (31)
P[sgn(f(x))=1]
where ‘recall’ can be estimated by computing 1 (cid:80) ℶ(sgn(f(x )) = 1) with
np xi∈X[p] i
the indicator function denoted by ℶ(·), and at the single-training-set scenario
P[sgn(f(x))=1]canbeestimatedbycomputing 1 (cid:80) ℶ(sgn(f(x ))=1).
np+nu xi∈X[pu] i
Furthermore, λ, σ were tuned from the set {1,2,3,4,5} ◦ {0.1,1,10,100}; C was
u
selected from the set {0.01,0.02,...,0.5} based on the setting in [26].
4.1.4 Results and Analysis
Results of the experiments on the constructed synthetic PU datasets are summarized
inTable1.TheperformancearemeasuredbytheaverageF1-score,whichisawidely-
usedmetricfortheevaluationofPUlearningmethods[41].Thepatternsofthedecision
boundary obtained by PUAL and GLLC on the synthetic datasets are illustrated in
Fig. 3. For each value of mean , we use the first generated synthetic dataset as
p2
example.
According to the experimental results in Table 1, PUAL always has better per-
formance than GLLC on the synthetic PU datasets with all the 5 values of mean .
p2
Furthermore,withthevalueofmean increasing,thegapbetweenPUALandGLLC
p2
becomes increasingly large. This is more clearly in the six plots in Fig. 3, as one of
the positive subset becomes increasingly far away, the decision boundary of GLLC
is dragged to a strange position that more and more instances are misclassified by
the decision boundary of GLLC, while the decision boundary of PUAL is unaffected.
Therefore,itisverifiedthatPUALcangeneratemuchbetterlineardecisionboundary

4.2.2 Compared Methods
GLLC, uPU and nnPU were also trained on the 16 real datasets as the compared
methods with PUAL. GLLC serves as the baseline of PUAL. uPU and nnPU are two
consistent PU learning methods.
4.2.3 Training-Test Split for the Real PU Datasets
Different from the steps in Section 4.1.2, PU training and test sets for the 16 real
datasetsareconstructedunderthecase-controlscenariosincewewouldliketoseethe

the two convincing methods for PU classification, i.e., uPU [19] and nnPU [20], since
theywereproposedunderthecase-controlscenario.Thestepstoperformtraining-test
split for the 16 PU real datasets are summarized as follows:
151. To obtain the binary positive-negative (PN) datasets from the original multi-class
dataset,certainclassesineachoftheoriginalrealdatasetsweretreatedaspositive
whilesomeotherclassesweretreatedasnegativewiththerestofclassesabandoned.
2. Toconstructthelabeled-positivesetandunlabeled-set,γ′ ofthepositiveinstances
in each binary PN dataset obtained in Step 1 were randomly selected to form
the labeled-positive set, and the rest of the positive instances were mixed into the
unlabeled set, contributing to the unlabeled set of the PU dataset.
3. TogeneratethetrainingsetandthetestsetfromtheconstructedPUdatasets,the
labeled-positive set and 70% of the instances in the unlabeled set were selected as
the training set while the test set was constituted by the rest 30% of the instances
in the unlabeled set; this corresponds to the setting of case-control scenario since
the unlabeled training set and the test set can be regarded to be sampled from the
same population.
During preliminary experiments, we found that the label frequency γ needs to be
greater than 20% for the hyper-parameter tuning strategy introduced in Section 4.2.4
to achieve adequate results. Therefore, the value of γ′ is set to 7 , 7 so that we
17 37
have the label frequency γ = γ′/(0.3γ′ +0.7) = 0.5,0.25, which is the fraction of
positiveinstancesthatarelabeled,inthecorrespondingconstructedPUtrainingsets,
respectively. Then Step 2 and Step 3 were repeated for 10 times on each of the 16
binary PN datasets and obtained 10 pairs of PU training and test sets for each of the
16 binary PN datasets with a certain value of γ′.
4.2.4 Model Setting
At the case-control scenario, we also use PUF-score in Equation (31) for hyper-
parameter selection. The numerator ‘recall’ can still be estimated by computing
1 (cid:80) ℶ(sgn(f(x )) = 1), while the denominator P[sgn(f(x)) = 1] needs to be
np xi∈X[p] i
estimated by computing 1 (cid:80) ℶ(sgn(f(x )) = 1) at the case-control scenario.
nu xi∈X[u] i
Therefore,byfixingC to1andthenumberK ofthenearestneighborsto5,C ,λ,σ
p u
in the objective functions of PUAL and GLLC were firstly tuned by 4-fold CV, which
reached the highest average PUF-score.
Furthermore, considering the higher complexity of the real datasets com-
pared with the synthetic datasets in Section 4.1, we modified our strategy
for hyper-parameter selection, enabling efficient selection of hyper-parameters
across a broader range. More specifically, λ, σ were tuned from the set
{10−4,10−3,10−2,10−1,100,101,102,103,104} and C was selected to from the set
u
{0.5,0.3,0.1,0.05,0.01} based on the setting in [26]. Then λ, σ and C were contin-
u
ually tuned following the greedy algorithm based on the average PUF-score on the
validation sets as follows:
1. Set λ, σ and C to the best combination from the grid search.
u
2. Sequentiallyupdateoneofhyper-parametersλ,σ andC byincreasing/decreasing
u
10% of its current value with the rest of the hyper-parameters unchanged. The
optimal scenario on 4-fold CV is set to be the final update of this step.
3. Repeat Step 2 until there is no better scenario appearing.
16In addition, the hyper-parameters of uPU and nnPU were fixed as the recom-
mended setting in the open source provided by [20] at https://github.com/kiryor/
nnPUlearning. Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel was applied to both PUAL and
GLLC. More specifically, we computed

4.2.8 Comparison between PUAL, uPU and nnPU
The performance of PUAL, GLLC, uPU and nnPU on the 16 real datasets are sum-
marized in Table 3, from which we can obtain the following findings. First, there are
in total 22 cases of the 32 cases where PUAL outperforms uPU and nnPU. Secondly,
uPU and nnPU sometimes have much larger standard deviations than PUAL since
their algorithms based on Adam for the optimization of their non-convex objective
functions cannot always converge to the optimal solution, although nnPU alleviates
this issue to some extent.

5 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose PUAL for better classification on trifurcate PU datasets,
where the positive set is constituted by two subsets distributing on both sides of the
negative set. The key novelty of PUAL is an asymmetric structure composed of hinge
loss and squared loss for training the PU classifier. Experimental results demonstrate
the superiority of PUAL in performing PU classification on trifurcate data. As an
SVM-basedmethod,PUALisstillnegativelyaffectedbytheirrelevantfeaturesinthe
datasets, partly due to the L2 regularization term of model parameters, which cannot
compress the coefficients of the irrelevant features to be exactly zero thoroughly [42].
To address this issue, a future work is to explore the L1 regularization term of the
model parameters for PUAL.
