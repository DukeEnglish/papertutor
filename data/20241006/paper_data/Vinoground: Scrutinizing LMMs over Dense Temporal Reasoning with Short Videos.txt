1 INTRODUCTION
Largemultimodalmodels(LMMs)havebecomeverycompetitiveinnotonlyimagecomprehension
but also short video comprehension. Proprietary models such as GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024a) and
Gemini-1.5-Pro (Gemini Team, 2024) as well as open-source models like LLaVA-OneVision (Li
etal.,2024a)andQwen2-VL(Wangetal.,2024)demonstratestrongperformanceinsummarizinga

Which video best fits the caption: The man moved the lid from the top to the side?
### In the first video, the man is seen moving the lid from the top of the box to the side.
In the second video, the man is seen moving the lid again, but this time it appears to be
more about adjusting the lid rather than moving it.
### Conclusion: The caption "the man used one hand to move the lid from the top of the box
to the side" matches the first video.

In this paper, we introduce Vinoground, a temporal counterfactual LMM evaluation benchmark
composed of 1000 short and natural video-caption pairs. Vinoground is a challenging benchmark
aimedtoexposetheincapabilitiesofstate-of-the-artmodelsinunderstandingtemporaldifferences
between different actions (e.g., “the man eats then watches TV” vs. “the man watches TV then
eats”) and object transformations (e.g., “water turning into ice” vs. “ice turning into water”). In
each pair of captions, the positive and negative are the same in word composition but different in
order. Our work is inspired by Winoground (Thrush et al., 2022), a challenging counterfactual
benchmark for visio-linguistic compositional reasoning in images. In Winoground, a model must
correctly match two images with their corresponding captions, where both captions use the same
setofwords,butarerearrangedtodescribeeachimage(e.g.,“someplantssurroundingalightbulb”

2 RELATED WORK
Counterfactual Reasoning Counterfactual reasoning (Morgan & Winship, 2015) in the context
of computer vision typically involves curating negative images and captions by manipulating the
originaldataandobservinghowtheoutcomechanges(Hendricksetal.,2018;Yehetal.,2019;Goyal
etal.,2019;Vermaetal.,2020;Guoetal.,2023;Zhangetal.,2021;Thrushetal.,2022;Leetal.,

3.3 CATEGORIZATION
Finally, we want to be able to evaluate LMMs in a fine-grained manner on multiple aspects rep-
resented by our dataset. Hence, we categorize Vinoground according to the unique characteristics

• Action, on the other hand, simply asks models to distinguish the order in which two or

watches TV and then eats.” The two actions need not be correlated at all, and thus less

usually accompanied by a drastic difference in between the frames, whereas other events

WeevaluatebothCLIP-basedmodels(Radfordetal.,2021)andlargegenerativemodels,bothpro-

for the model’s input, we make sure we sample (N −1)/2 frames from the positive and negative
video fragments and at least 1 frame of black screen in between. For the sake of consistency, we
provide all models with the single concatenated video, regardless of how many videos they can
actually take as input. We then prompt the model with “<video> Which video segment matches
this caption? Note: The video contains two segments separated by a 2-second black frame. Cap-
tion: {Caption}. A.Firstsegment(beforeblackframe),B.Secondsegment(afterblackframe)”to
choose between the two video segments. We also report the results with respect to the number of
framessampledbythemodelfromthevideo, ifsupported, toevaluatetheeffectoftemporalityin
Section4.4.1.
In addition, we also use Prolific (https://www.prolific.com) to evaluate human perfor-
mance,andfindthatourdatasetisfairlyeasyforanaveragehumantocompletewithhighaccuracy.
Prolific is a platform similar to Amazon MTurk which recruits workers to complete tasks such as
data annotation. The interface we present to the workers is in Appendix D. To filter out unfaith-
ful workers, we employ a qualification process prior to evaluating on Vinoground. We sample 10
video-question pairs from TempCompass (Liu et al., 2024b) that are of the event order category,
whichcontainsconcatenatedvideoswithnocorrelation,suchas“amanliftsweightsinagym,then
a cat plays on the grass”. Such examples are easy enough for an average human to obtain 100%
accuracy. We ask the workers the 10 beginner-level questions first, and they are qualified only if
theyanswereveryquestioncorrectly. Thisprocessresultsin170qualifiedworkers.
We conduct human evaluation under two settings. First, the Prolific workers are provided the full
videos with audio. To create another environment where we want the workers see the same input
as the models, we uniformly sample 32 frames from each video and concatenate them together
into a new 10-second video with no audio. The results for the two settings are also compared in
Section4.4.1. Foreachquestion, weobtainanswersfrom10uniqueworkers. Forthe10answers
from a single question, we calculate the “average” human response by taking the mode of the 10
answers. Wethenreportthemeanoverallthequestionsasthefinalresult.

4.4 IN-DEPTHANALYSISOFPERFORMANCEVARIATIONS
4.4.1 FRAMESSAMPLED
Vinoground’s temporal understanding requirements can be demonstrated by varying the different
number of frames sampled, either from the video entirely, or as measured by frames-per-second
(fps).Ifadatasetsuffersfrom‘single-framebias’,amodelwouldnotperformverydifferentlywhen
only1ormoreframesaresampled. Theresultsofthestrongestproprietaryandopen-sourcemod-
elsinTable3(andadditionalresultsinAppendixF)showthatthemoreframesamodeltakes,the
better its performance. This indicates that a model does need the entirety of each video to fully
comprehendthetaskathand. Interestingly,toomanysampledframes,however,canhurtamodel’s

its32-framevariant. Wesuspectthatcurrentmodelsarenotgoodatdiscardingredundantinforma-

Finally, for human evaluators, the ‘All’ group performs better than the 32 frame group, which in-
dicates that humans can answer Vinoground questions better when the full videos are shown. In

5 CONCLUSION
We introduced Vinoground, a novel temporal counterfactual benchmark encompassing 1000 short
andnaturalvideo-captionpairs.Wedemonstratedthatexistingvideounderstandingmodelsarequite
incapable in terms of temporal reasoning, even for short (<10 seconds) videos. While an average
humancaneasilyandaccuratelycompleteourbenchmark,thebestmodel,GPT-4o,performsmuch
worse, and most models barely perform better than random chance. Our work demonstrates that
there is much more to do still in the area of short video comprehension. We believe our bench-
mark can serve as an important checkpoint in evaluating a model’s true performance for temporal
understandingofdifferentactions,backgroundtransitions,andobjecttransformations.

C RANDOM CHANCE PERFORMANCE
Wesettherandomchanceperformancefortext,video,andgroupscoreas25%,25%,and16.67%.
It is intuitive to understand the setup for both text and video score since there are two questions
in the same counterfactual pair for each metric, and the probability of guessing correctly is 50%
each. For the counterfactual pair (C ,C′,V ,V′), a model can only produce six possible permu-
i i i i
tationsofvideo-captionmatchings: {(C ,V ),(C′,V′)},{(C ,V ),(C ,V′)},{(C ,V ),(C′,V )},
i i i i i i i i i i i i
